Let the radius of the field be R and the length of the rope be L.\\n\\nThe grazable area is the union of a segment of the circular field and a segment of the circle defined by the rope length.  (A segment of a circle is a sector of a circle less the triangle defined by the center of the circle and the endpoints of the arc.)  The area of a segment of a circle of radius $R$ with central angle $t$ is $\\\\frac{1}{2}R^2(t-\\\\sin(t))$, where $t$ is measured in radians.\\n\\nIn order to express the grazable area in terms of $R$ and one angle, we consider the angles ∠CED and ∠CAD (which define the segments of the circles; call these α and β for convenience) and the triangle CEF. Let $\\\\theta$ be ∠EFC. $2\\\\theta$ is an inscribed angle for the central angle $\\\\beta$ over the same arc, making $\\\\beta = 4\\\\theta$.
