It has provided a medium for us to maintain relationships with loved ones globally and enabled swift sharing of thoughts and news.\n\nPerson 2: Although your point is valid, I still hold that the adverse effects of social media eclipse the positive. It has resulted in social aloofness, augmented stress levels and anxiety, and most alarmingly, it has engendered disunity in the manner in which people converse and interact with one another, online or otherwise. \n\nPerson 1: I contest that view. In my opinion, social media has the potential to unify individuals in significant ways. It has granted youngsters a platform to voice their thoughts and discover their identity as well as propagate innovative ideas. \n\nPerson 2: While that's a fair point, I reckon the negative aspects are more deep-seated and persistent. It would be wise to reconsider pouring so much of ourselves into this medium. \n\nPerson 1: What is your suggestion then?\n\nPerson 2: We ought to be aware of the time we dedicate to social media - it should serve as an instrument, not a life-style. Further, we must be mindful of our choice of words since online interaction lacks clear indicators of sentiment, expression, and non-verbal cues. \n\nPerson 1: I am on the same page with that.",

It's led to social reclusiveness, increased anxiety levels, and notably, fueled divisions in the communication and interaction between individuals, both virtually and physically. \n\nPerson 1: I view it differently. For me, social media serves to unite individuals in significant ways. It has contributed to youth self-expression and identity discovery, as well as the open exchange of innovative ideas.\n\nPerson 2: I see your point, however, I argue that the detriments are deeper and ubiquitously felt. We should contemplate before dedicating so much time and effort in this arena. \n\nPerson 1: What's the course of action, according to you?\n\nPerson 2: We should be conscious of the time we allot to social media; it ought to be a resource, not a lifestyle.
