        "output_2": "No, it is not a good idea at all. It will be worse, not better. What you are missing here is that cocoa powder does not dissolve at all, never, it just disperses in water (or milk). So there is no reason why methods for dissolving stuff would work with cocoa powder. You will need to use a method created for colloid-producing powders like cocoa powder, which is mostly starch with fat.   This is why the answers to the other question recommend the slurry method. When you are dispersing an absorptive powder like starch, you always run a risk of clumping, and the slurry is designed to work around that problem. But starch also thickens much more under heat, so if you were to not just forego the slurry, but simply drop the cocoa powder into hot water, this would be the worst choice possible, leading to instant unbreakable clumps. The slurry method wouldn't work with hot water either, you'll get clumps before you have created the slurry.   So, the short answer is: if you try it, it won't \"dissolve automatically\", it will produce an ugly undrinkable mixture of clumps.  ",

Bread should be handled with clean hands. Bread should be kept well wrapped. Refrigeration dramatically slows mold growth. Freezing virtually stops mold growth.

Slice and create divisions all over your pan as desired, even using a T-square for uniformity. Bake this off. Experiment with cooking times to make sure the top is sufficiently hardened and caramelized, so you can easily take each piece out as bars, after they've cooled.  In addition, some granola bar recipes simply call for refrigerating mixtures and slicing after chilling overnight. This really just lets moisture present in the mixture penetrate oatmeal to release starches, along with the setting of the caramel, making for a soft and non-hardened granola bar that won't break your teeth!

        "output_2": "One good method that can help you get solid  results is grinding some of the oats in your recipe into oat flour.  Grinding the oats allows the starches in the oats to absorb liquids, which then swell and solidify when baked. This is the same way that all cookies and the like get their solidity, by starches that set.  My suggestion is to take a portion of the oats that you are using in the recipe and grind it in the food processor until it resembles coarse flour. After mixing together your wet ingredients (oil, sugar, honey), add  the oat flour and mix well before adding in your inclusions (whole oats, nuts, dried fruit, etc).  In addition, don't stir during baking, as this will allow the clusters to form better.  I personally make granola bars with this method, and they come out quite good. ",

        "output_1": "I have been roasting coffee for a few years and have never heard of this. It wasn't so easy to find on Google. From An Overview of Vietnamese Coffee:     Thirdly, beans are generally roasted in what is referred to as \"butter oil\", which may or may not be actual clarified butter oil. Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional \"home-grown\" coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process.    I also googled pan roasting techniques. Apparently you should be able to achieve a roasting time of 15-20 minutes. So you are spending several minutes at 200C. With such a small amount of butter and sugar, I wonder when you add the extra ingredients to the pan so as to not burn the coating.  If just using the oil to help the beans turn, then I imagine adding the oil from the start will work.  I might have to try this myself. ",

The parboiled wedges are coated in a mixture from the flour and some seasonings, then frozen and deep-fried.   But while net surfing I came across harmful effects of refined white flour. Is there a substitute for refined flour? Or are there other ways to get crispy wedges? ",
        "output_1": "The coating of flour serves two purposes at once. First, it carries flavor - the flour-seasoning mix sticks better to the potatoes than a seasoning-only mixture could. Second, it gives you a crisp texture, absorbing oil, without letting much oil through to the actual potato, to prevent it from getting greasy.   For both, the closer you get to pure starch, the better results you will get. You can use a refined flour or starch made from practically any tuber or grain with good results. Which one you choose is probably a matter of practicality, as not all of them are equally available everywhere.   If you want to come away from the starch, whole-grain flours will also work reasonably well. Choose finely ground ones and be aware that most of them will introduce their own taste. This can be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether you like the taste combination. I would refrain from the strongest tasting ones such as maize flour.   I would advise against legume or nut flours. They contain even less starch than whole grain flours, but exactly for this reason they will fail at the two roles I noted above.   If you are asking yourself why you would want to go to alternatives with less starch: most of the concerns this article has about \"refined white flour\" (which happens to be about 90% wheat starch) are commonly expressed for all kinds of starch (except for numbers 5 and 6 which are wheat-specific). So, if you believe the article, you should avoid everything well-suited as a replacement for the flour, and look for alternatives which deliver an acceptable result while introducing less starch into your diet. While researching this, don't forget that the potatoes will deliver the largest starch amount in this recipe anyway, so if you decide to reduce starch consumption, you should probably remove this from the menu altogether.

My hunch is that you'd be right on two counts: namely the amount of oil and if the wok is adequately seasoned. I'm assuming your wok is iron since you're speaking about seasoning. Similar to cast iron skillets/pans, adequate seasoning will help create a non-stick coating, but if you're washing your wok between uses, my sense is that it's not getting a chance to develop that seasoning. If you want your wok to be seasoned, you may be best off to go out of your way to specifically season it a few times before cooking on it as it's hard to get a seasoning going without a few starter coats, especially if you're cooking something that can strip away seasoning (e.g., acidic foods) or using utensils that are not seasoning friendly (e.g., typical metal wok utensils).  As for the oil, make sure you add it to the wok and allow it to heat up before adding your food. Remember to keep the wok nice and hot and cook over high temperature so that it cooks evenly and quickly, with quick stirring, rather than letting it rest long enough to burn/create a sticky base. Make sure your food is not wet as well. This will help the wok maintain a high temperature and cook your food quickly. If you add oil while the food is already in the pan, you're unlikely to get the oil evenly over your food and whatever excess won't get under the food to create a barrier from sticking either.   Some things also just burn easier, especially without oil. E.g., when using freshly prepared rice versus leftover rice; certain sauces, etc.  Hope this helps. ",

This is easy for them since they have sinks under their woks to catch the rinse water but you can do it at home, too. This is the process recommended here     Wok cooking is done in many small batches to keep the temperature of the wok from dropping drastically when adding a lot of cold or room temperature ingredients therefore it is  often necessary to clean the wok in between batches. Use warm water and a brush to rinse out the wok, discard the water and dry the wok over fire until it just barely starts to smoke before adding oil to cook the next batch.  ",

You absolutely do not marry flavors when the heat is on.   My grandmother used to say, you need to rest the sauce when cooked and reheat as desired, but never reboil. As the sauce cools it not only marries flavors, but thickens considerably.

Sucrose forms a saturated aqueous solution at ~200 g sucrose per 100 g water at 15C/~60F - for 10 kg of dry sucrose, you'd need a minimum ~5 L tap cold water to dissolve it - without accounting for the water it's already absorbed. You can add this water to the sugar before pouring down the drain to dissolve it first, and if you knew the mass of water absorbed you can subtract that amount. There's low risk of clogging since sucrose readily dissolves in water - and if it does, add hot water.  Added clarification for dissolving sugar:  ~5 litres of tap-cold, 15C water is the minimum amount physically required to dissolve ~10 kg sucrose for energy and water-saving purposes. More water can be used to dissolve this.  Dissolved sucrose flows easily and further dilutes very readily. The same cannot be said for other types of fluid sugars, i.e. high-fructose corn syrup, honey, caramel - these flow and dissolve very differently, and in the case of honey, may rapidly crystallize before dissolving.  The experimental solubility of sucrose in water (grams per gam) is 1.94 @15C, 1.89 @10c, 1.85 @5C, 1.81 @0C. Given a worst-case scenario with 10 kg sucrose saturated solution at 15C being instantaneously chilled and ignoring the enthalpy of crystallization: At 10C, 258 g sucrose will precipitate, requiring an additional 138 mL of water (slightly more than half a cup) to remain dissolved; At 5C, 464 g sucrose will precipitate, requiring an additional 251 mL of water (one cup) to remain dissolved; At 0C, 671 g sucrose will precipitate, requiring an additional 371 mL of water to remain dissolved - if your indoor pipes are at 0C, you've got bigger problems to worry about.  The kitchen sink and not flush toilets is the preferred disposal receptacle for both efficiency of water use and ease of addressing clogs. Both should have p-bends/air traps to stop sewer gases entering the home, though the kitchen sink will 1) be more easily accessible with the trap normally in a vertical line under the sink drain, 2) the toilet's thermal mass may rapidly cool any added hot water, and 3) some toilets may feature multiple bend traps, leaving undissolved sugar stuck in harder to reach areas.

Dehydration time would be longer and you'd need a larger volume container, but you would also not need to have it in direct contact with the meat.

Most tutorials include the filled jar being heated up (in a water bath) and then (or even while heating) being turned on its head and being let to cool in this position until it is ready to be stored away.  Most tutorials mention, that there is a vacuum being formed, and the jar being on its head somehow helps the process.  It looks something like this:    The way I understand it is that during the heating process the air in the jar expands and escapes the jar, which reduces the air.  What I don't understand is why this is necessary, obviously there is no perfect vacuum and why the jar needs to be turned on its head?  Also, since the jar is cooked and all bacteria killed, why is air a problem? ",
        "output_1": "Generally turning a jar upside down after filling is a alternative to a proper hot-water bath, not an addition to it.  This is known as the inversion method, and is used by many cooks of jams, jellies, mustards, and other very-low-risk canned foods.  The idea of inversion canning is that, by forcing the air in the jar through the hot liquid, you can kill and bacteria in the air (and on the inside of the lid).  It is not considered safe by experts, because there are numerous ways that bacteria can survive the process.  If you are doing \"proper\" canning, that is heating up the lidded jar to 85C or above, the sealing, inverting the jars is in fact a bad idea as it could result in liquid preventing the jar lid from sealing properly. The Ball jar corporation says “Do not invert. move or store jars while cooling, as this may cause seal failure.” At the least, it's unnecessary. ",
        "output_2": "I agree with the above response, in that it is safer to sterilise by immersing the entire jar in boiling water. However, in answer to your question, the idea is to sterilise the lid and inner rim of the jar after sealing by getting them to >85°C for 10 mins. This only works if you make sure you bottle your preserve when far hotter than 85°C so that it takes longer than 10 mins to drop below that temp. Assuming you have steam or oven sterilised your jars before bottling, you are only killing the stray bug that floats into the jar in the brief moment when you open it and pour in the preserve before replacing the lid.

The rationale is achieving an instant 7-log reduction in pathogens - 1 surviving bacteria per 10,000,000 viable bacteria per mass unit of food for the most heat-resistant organism, typically Listeria monocytogenes. The concern in seitan products is more for ready-made refrigerated commercial varieties, as these may carry pathogens from handling prior to packaging and the seitan itself has a nutrient profile hospitable to their growth. The difference in time to achieve lethality at 158F vs 160F is negligible without even considering dwell time, and is fine for safety. Regarding texture - two article abstracts on temperature effects on gluten structure:  [...]Chromatographic examination showed that free sulphydryl groups were found predominantly in glutenin aggregates of lowest molecular weight and in gliadins; sulphydryl groups in these glutenin species were particularly involved in the changes occurring at 55–75°C. These data indicate that there are heat-induced alterations in gluten proteins at temperatures above 55°C, which appear to be involved in the loss of functionality (baking performance) on heating. It is postulated that the glutenin proteins are unfolded on heating up to 75°C and that this facilitates sulphydryl/disulphide interchange between exposed groups. The protein is then ‘locked’ into the denatured state on cooling due to this disulphide bond rearrangement. At temperatures above 75°C the gliadin proteins are also affected, involving similar mechanisms.[...] J.D.Schofield, R.C.Bottomley, M.F.Timms, M.R.Booth, The effect of heat on wheat gluten and the involvement of sulphydryl-disulphide interchange reactions, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0733-5210(83)80012-5   [...]Oscillatory measurements of optimally hydrated vital gluten describing network properties of the material show two structural changes along a temperature ramp from 25 to 90 °C: at 56–64 °C, the temperature necessary to trigger structural changes increases with the ratio of gliadin to total protein mass, determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). At a temperature of 79–81 °C, complete protein denaturation occurs.[...] Monika C.Wehrlia, Tim Kratky, Marina Schopf, Katharina A. Scherf, Thomas Becker, Mario Jekle, Thermally induced gluten modification observed with rheology and spectroscopies, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.008  The recipe you provided gave 160F for an internal temperature when baking, which also falls in the ranges stated above. The 190-200F+ temperature for breads is for the rapid dehydration of starches via escaping steam, otherwise the crumb would remain damp and doughy. The gluten structure in the linked recipe also appeared to have already been well-developed prior to heating. Gluten structure can be formed at room temperature as seen there and in high-hydration no-knead bread recipes. My experience with canned seitan and fried seitan, both commercially produced, is that it can easily withstand boiling temperatures and higher with little to no effect on texture. The starch component in the chickpeas, however, may go past gelling point and weep moisture when chilled if over hydrated and boiled. ",

There are a few examples (courtesy Jefromi and Jay's comments, respectively) of this in Chinese cooking: baozi, a filled dumpling using yeast dough; or the larger mantou, similar but without filling.    When steaming dough it will retain much more (nearly all) water, so a drier dough would be in order.  Generally in most bread-baking, the goal as Julio mentions is to get the inside to 200-210 °F, and by using steam at ~212 °F, you will get virtually no browning.  That said, crust can vary wildly, from very soft to very hard.  The softer crust breads I bake are usually done in pans at lower temperatures (325-375 °F) and often contain milk, eggs and or fat.

The answer she links to is a solid technique. That's how my mom has always done it, and people are always amazed at how well it turns out. But I got obsessed with kimchi just in time for the hallyu wave a few years ago and I experimented altogether too much with rice. .....and to reiterate the comment I left above, never add butter or salt to cooking rice. For me it ruins the flavor. I'm all grown-up with two opposable thumbs. I'll get butter if I want it lol. But usually I don't. If your rice needs to be rinsed, it should say so in the cooking instructions on the package. (Barely add enough water to wet all the rice and you'll be able to get most excess starch off quickly. You'll have to rinse it 3 or 4 times at least.) I rinse rice by default now. My mom makes fun of me, but she doesn't think the rice turns out badly at all. Some varieties of rice call for soaking before you drain completely, measure out the water, and cook. Others don't call for a soak, but do expect you to heat the rice with the water just to a simmer.....While you can cook these using Jolene's method, they might not be as fluffy. It's a subtle difference though. I've also had rice that came out markedly better on the stovetop than it did following rice cooker directions, and vice versa. I can't tell you why, but it's something to be aware of. All of which is to say that if your rice doesn't turn out right the first time, you can try different techniques and also try different rice. There are also tons of general techniques that are completely different from Jolene's that are worth looking into. This site for example...looks promising? I might try it just to see how my own medium grain rice turns out: https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-steam-rice/#:~:text=Place%20in%20a%20steamer%20filled,at%20least%205%20more%20minutes. The ratio for long grain rice to water is 1:1.3. The instructions say to soak your rice for at least 10 minutes. Place the rice and water in a heat proof bowl, then place that bowl in a cold steamer. It says specifically not to preheat. Then turn the heat on to high for 20 minutes with the lid closed, heat off, and let sit for at least 5 minutes or until ready to serve. I don't have a commercial steamer either, so what I'll do is put down a cheap vegetable steamer tray in my big pot and set my bowl on top of it.

Update Please read e.g. Douglas Baldwins Practical Guide to Sous Vide, I think he is much more qualified than you and me. He clearly states e.g.      You were probably taught that there’s a “danger zone” between 40°F and 140°F (4.4°C and 60°C). These temperatures aren’t quite right: it’s well known that food pathogens can only multiply between 29.7°F (-1.3°C) and 126.1°F (52.3°C), while spoilage bacteria begin multiplying at 23°F (-5°C)    and      So why were you taught that food pathogens stop multiplying at 40°F (4.4°C) and grow all the way up to 140°F (60°C)? Because it takes days for food pathogens to grow to a dangerous level at 40°F (4.4°C) (FDA, 2011) and it takes many hours for food to be made safe at just above 126.1°F (52.3°C) – compared with only about 12 minutes (for meat) and 35 minutes (for poultry) to be made safe when the coldest part is 140°F (60°C)   and     Indeed, the food pathogens that can multiply down to 29.7°F (-1.3°C) – Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes – can only multiply about once per day at 40°F (4.4°C) and so you can hold food below 40°F (4.4°C) for five to seven days (FDA, 2011). At 126.1°F (52.3°C), when the common food pathogen Clostridium perfringens stops multiplying, it takes a very long time to reduce the food pathogens we’re worried about – namely the Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, and the pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli – to a safe level; in a 130°F (54.4°C) water bath (the lowest temperature I recommend for cooking sous vide) it’ll take you about 2½ hours to reduce E. coli to a safe level in a 1 inch (25 mm) thick hamburger patty and holding a hamburger patty at 130°F (54.4°C) for 2½ hours is inconceivable with traditional cooking methods – which is why the “danger zone” conceived for traditional cooking methods doesn’t start at 130°F (54.4°C). [Note that Johnson et al. (1983) reported that Bacillus cereus could multiply at 131°F/55°C, but no one else has demonstrated growth at this temperature and so Clostridium perfringens is used instead.]   So what he calls pathogens DIE at 50C and they die even faster at 55 or 60. IF this is true, what is the problem with the 30 days brisket at 60C? That is my question. I don't want to hear about danger zone, I know what it is and that it is exaggerated to be simpler and safer to use. If you don't believe me, that's fine, but then no need to answer. ",
        "output_1": "40-140F is the danger zone of high growth rate for bacteria.  60-120F is the extremely high zone.  55C is only 131F and not even out of the high growth rate area, 60C it at the edge right at 140.    Outside of the high growth area bacteria growth is not zero, it is only much lower and there is not a magic switch that instantly kills all bacteria when you hit 60C.  The safety rules say that at that point you have reduced risk, not zero risk.  Bacterial growth certainly continues simply at a lower rate.  However, a lower rate over longer time still constitutes rot and danger.  The safety provided by reaching a prescribed temp is negated by then trying to stay there for an unreasonable time.  No guides that say to reach that temperature for safety state that all bacteria are killed, only that many are and those that survive will not be reproducing at rates to be a likely danger if you otherwise handle the item appropriately.  Waiting another 30 days is not handling it appropriately.  In addition, there is more to decay of a piece of meat than just microbial action.  You have cell structure breaking down, chemicals being released, etc.  I would fully expect, in fact be shocked, if the brisket in question would not effectively begin the equivalent of digesting itself.  Bad smells and a texture approaching jelly would not be surprising in the least.  A potentially interesting science experiment, but nothing resembling food should come from any such tests. ",
        "output_2": "In addition to @dlb's answer - there are a huge range of bacteria present in our food sources - many of these are capable of growing at higher temperatures than normal food safety requirements reach. The reason it is still safe to eat food at this point, is that the stomach and intestines are pretty good at breaking down most bacteria, so that they don't cause infection. Generally the problem comes when there is a high bacterial load in a food stuff.  However, there are a bunch of common bacteria that are facultative anaerobes (means can function as anaerobes or not depending on circumstances), and many are also facultative thermophiles (like high heat, but can also grow at lower temps). There's a nice chapter (paywall most likely) in this book: P.J. McClure, 21 - Spore-forming bacteria, Editor(s): Clive de W. Blackburn, In Woodhead Publishing Series in Food Science, Technology and Nutrition, Food Spoilage Microorganisms, Woodhead Publishing, 2006. It indicates that many of these bacteria are from or closely related to the genus Clostridium - a well known food spoilage organism. Other commonly found bacterial genera are Bacillus and Geobacillus, which are also commonly food-poisoning associated.   Having said that, there's one in the list of bacteria that is particularly interesting in terms of stinky smells and high temps for extended periods: Desulfotomaculum nigrificans. As you might be able to tell from the name, this one produces H2S AKA Hydrogen Sulfide - the rotten egg smell and you also get the same smell around geothermal areas. The bacterium also blackens the food - probably from reduction of the sulfur I would guess. Here's what the article had to say about growth:      Canned/hermetically sealed products held at high temperature (> 55 °C) for extended periods   This seems like the most likely culprit for stinky sous vide, but I would be willing to bet that it's not the only species present.

If you leave the bread to rest for a while (a couple of hours or even more in a banneton before putting it in the Dutch oven) you will get a better rise and flavour. Also, as Stephie said, use very good quality flours. Both things combined and you're done. No need to add sugar, fat or other things.  If you do not have the time, adding more yeast will reduce the resting (and rising) time, but the bread will get less flavour. But if your bread is going to be very hydrated (as it seems), I would really recommend to have patience in the process of kneading and letting rest the bread before cooking it. ",

A steak on a grill, you start that something like half an hour before you're going to eat, and that includes starting the charcoal. Less time for gas. A quick sous vide steak would probably be around an hour twenty before. Most of that time is just a bag sitting in the water bath, you don't even need to be home watching it. But it'd be a very late dinner after getting home from work.   The basic workflow is first prep and sometimes brown ingredients, second get them in a bag, third they sit in the water bath for a long time (hours, typically), fourth pull from water bath, fifth finish (brown again, garnish with sauces, season, etc.).  And honestly, it's fiddly. At least with reasonably priced equipment. You can (and I often do) use ziploc freezer bags, but getting enough air out so they don't float takes practice (and good clips to attach them to a rack).

It's pretty simple; simmer equal parts sugar and water with varying amounts of pumpkin puree, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, ginger, etc. for about 20 minutes or so.  The problem is that none of these spices are soluble in water, and I can't seem to strain out the solids enough to where it won't make my coffee \"gritty.\" I've tried filtering the mixture through a metal sieve used for cold brew, but the grains are much smaller than ground coffee, so it (mostly) passes through the pores.  I tried cheesecloth, but it clogs up quickly and turns into a mess.  The most success I've had was pouring the mixture through paper coffee filters straight from the stove while it was still boiling hot, but this has a few issues:  The mixture forms a \"skin\" at the bottom of the coffee filter and the flow slows to a few drips at a time as it cools. To hurry things along, I wind up going back and forth between two containers using a clean coffee filter each time, but I wind up wasting a ton of filters this way. Doing it like this takes hours and it still laves a gritty, sludgy mouthfeel in my coffee.  Honestly, this process is making me feel quite stupid.  What do I do? ",

I'd still use coffee filters, but start with one of the other suggestions: either cheesecloth or sedimentation, to get a rather cloudy liquid that will filter fairly easily ",

You don't describe your process with cheesecloth in much detail, but I would suggest  line a colander with a couple of layers of cheesecloth, and place that colander over a bowl to collect your pumpkin spice syrup;  pour the mixture of spices, simple syrup, and pumpkin puree through the cheesecloth;  let this stand for five or ten minutes;  (this is the step you seem to be missing) gather up the cheesecloth into something that resembles a bindle, and squeeze; you should be able to get a good amount of the remaining syrup out of this mass.   As an optional final step, run the resulting syrup through a coffee filter. Whole Spices You don't describe the state of the spices that you are using, but it sounds like you might be using ground spices.  If so, and especially if you are using pre-ground spices from the grocery, I would suggest not doing this.  Use whole (or slightly broken up) cinnamon sticks, use whole (or gently crushed) cloves and allspice, and use (maybe) diced crystalized ginger. You will likely have to steep these things a bit longer, but the advantage is that the spices will be large enough to mostly strain out with a strainer, and should not clog up a coffee filter or cheesecloth. Recipe It might also be worth noting that the \"traditional\" pumpkin spice latte is made with a pumpkin spice syrup, which contains the flavors of spices which one would use in a pumpkin pie (clove, ginger, cinnamon, etc), but which does not actually contain any pumpkin or pumpkin flavor.

If your problem is graininess, then you could either sieve the ground almonds before using or blitz/grind them finer in a food processor until the desired consistency is reached, however if you're grinding them in a food processor make sure you do it in small batches or if you're making macarons blitz them with the icing sugar (for the tant pour tant) to avoid making almond butter.

        "output_2": " Coated (e. g. enamel, PTFE, ceramic)  I can't answer in general, but that one's easy. Sudden thermal shock causes strain in a material by unequal expansion, either in the same material by high thermal gradients, or in interfaces between materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion. The strain in this case (two different materials) can be very high. If the material in question is not elastic (e.g. enamel + ceramic; I would think PTFE is different, but I'm not sure), then the bonds between the coating and the metal would be severely strained and it would likely crack and chip. I can tell you from personal experience that I have actually used this to my advantage: In the spring, I produce a small quantity of maple syrup by boiling sap in an uncoated stainless steel pan. On rare occasions, accompanied by the release of many expletives, I have let the syrup boil down too far, at which point it burns and seems to coat the bottom of the pan with a thin but hard and very resilient layer of carbon black. The trick to removing this stuff is to get some kind of stress crack started, e.g. by scrubbing w/ steel wool or a copper pad, and then what I do is I put the pan on the stove for a while to let it heat up hot (but not red hot), and then bring it over to the sink and spray cold water on the inside pan bottom where the carbon black has stuck to. After a few times, the carbon black will start to flake off and then it becomes easier to remove by a combination of abrasion and thermal shock. (The two pans I've done this on have been fine; both are stainless steel with a thick (>8mm) bottom, and I've put them through at least 30 or 40 thermal cycles of this type.)  edit re: general topic: Wikipedia says this:  The robustness of a material to thermal shock is characterized with the thermal shock parameter:  where  k is thermal conductivity, σT is maximal tension the material can resist, α is the thermal expansion coefficient E is the Young's modulus, and ν is the Poisson ratio.   Higher thermal conductivity means it's more difficult to get a large thermal gradient across the material (less prone to shock); higher thermal expansion means more strain (more prone to shock), and higher Young's modulus means more stress for a given strain (more prone to shock). So theoretically you could compare the different materials. (exercise for the reader ;) Most likely copper would be more resilient than the other metals, because of its higher thermal conductivity and higher ductility. Thermal conductivity k: Copper = 401, Aluminum alloys = 120-180, stainless steel = 12-45 (units = W/m*K) σT: no idea: Coefficient of thermal expansion α: Copper = 17, Aluminum = 23, iron = 11.1, stainless steel = 17.3 (units = 10−6/°C) Young's modulus E: Copper = 117, Aluminum = 69, iron/steel = around 200 (units = GPa) Poisson's ratio ν: Copper/stainless steel/aluminum are all around 0.3-0.33, cast iron = 0.21-0.26 So stainless steel is worse than aluminum or copper (much lower thermal conductivity, higher Young's modulus).

In addition to being split, the seed coat of the lentils has been removed, so if they are cooked thoroughly there isn't really anything holding them together.   Usually they are just simmered in a liquid until tender. The seasonings are up to your personal taste, or the recipe you are using. The one advice that I would give is to taste as you go. If you want the lentils to remain whole, be sure to avoid overcooking them. Conversely, if you want a smooth texture, cook them until completely tender.

Flour with high protein level is known as 'bread flour', and flour with low protein level is 'cake flour'. Flour containing more protein will develop more gluten, making for a stronger, stretchier, chewier dough. That's great for bread, particularly breads that you want to have a chewier texture and firmer crust such as baguettes, sourdough, rustic breads, and so on. Lower protein flour is used for softer products such as cakes, muffins, and biscuits (in the American sense, meaning chemically leavened dinner rolls, not the British sense of cracker or cookie). With its medium protein level, AP can be used for either breads or cakes and will give a product that's neither very chewy nor very soft. ",

Atta flour is made from durum wheat, which is used for things like pasta (and of course Indian breads like chapatis).   Maida flour is made with 'regular' wheat, but it also has a lower protein content than all-purpose flour (8-10% as opposed to 9-12%). The impact of this lower protein level will depend on what you're cooking. Maida flour should be good for making cakes, for example. ",

Yes, using dried shiitake mushrooms (in Cantonese, also called \"winter\" mushrooms) is quite essential to this recipe. The sun-drying process breaks down proteins to amino acids, so it increases the umami flavor of the mushrooms, providing strong flavors that could not be matched by fresh shiitake mushrooms. For some references, see this page. In Chinese cooking, dried raw materials are often more prized than their fresh variant due to the higher intensity of flavor. For example, dried scallops vs fresh scallops, and dried abalone vs fresh abalone. The dried variant provides much more intense flavor, and is thus much more expensive. If you really can't find dried shiitake mushrooms, you could use way more fresh shiitakes, maybe squeeze the water out of it to reduce the volume. You could also use other means to make up for the lost amino acid content by using chicken stock, or, er, MSG. However, the amino acids in chicken stock and/or MSG wouldn't be the same as those in dried shiitakes, so the flavor would be still somehow different. Yet another alternative is to enrich the flavor in other ways: for example, add some Cantonese barbequed pork belly meat to the braise to create a thicker flavor (as is done for many Cantonese braises).

These days I can get fresh shiitake in any supermarket [London, UK]. Shiitake are a fairly 'meaty' mushroom anyway. From dried you need to soak them in boiling water to scare some life back into them [& I'd definitely keep that soaking water with the potential to use is as extra 'stock' if needed]. Fresh have a 'bite' to them, for sure, but dried definitely have a 'chew' too. I used to end up throwing half the lower stalk away as being too tough to want to eat. I honestly can't remember if there's a significant flavour difference, but if you've ever had mushroom ketchup, that's how I recall the taste of dried. It's somehow more 'fermented'. Maybe in some dishes, that's a desired flavour profile. It's certainly not 'bad' in itself, merely different. ",

Example:  We're only sweating the onion, afterwards we'll add some garlic and that way we'll have a nice base layer to work with, remember its all about layering flavors  What? What does that mean? How is layering flavors going to help? Is it going to change taste as you chew? Or is it just a fancy way of saying it’s going to have a bit of added taste and it’s going to be wonderful? And how do I do it? The only thing I see is people adding ingredients to a sauce and cooking them in some way. ",
        "output_1": "It is mostly a fancy way of saying that they are combining flavors. There are no solid, physical layers involved anywhere. Still, there is a reason why the \"layering\" metaphor is more apt than simply saying \"combining\". Flavor is mostly about aroma, which leads to two aspects of \"layering\". First, aroma is not perceived all at once when you bite off. You first notice the most volatile smell notes when the food enters your mouth, go through a kind of \"middle\" and only at the end, while swallowing, you notice the \"heavier\" flavor. So, when seasoning, you can work with food such that you don't mix up too many flavors in one of the three aroma \"layers\", but also to make sure that there is something noticeable in each of the three. Second, people are accustomed to some flavors being present as a metaphorical \"background\" taste. It can happen that, if the expected aroma is absent, you can add all the spices you want, and the eater will still experience it as underseasoned. This is what is happening in the example you cited: the \"base layer\" are the onion and garlic, which are probably the standard for the dish, and then you can take that dish in different directions by your choice of additional herbs and spices. In that case, you can see the metaphor as akin to clothing - once you have a basic shirt on, you can always make the outfit nicer by layering a scarf, jacket or jewelry on top of it. All in all, it is not \"all about layering flavors\". It is just an expression which helps some cooks go about creating harmonious flavor combinations. If it works for you, use it. If not, learn to think about your seasoning in other terms. ",
        "output_2": "One perspective I've encountered looks at specific types of ingredients when discussing 'layering.' For example, 'layering salt' is about adding saltiness to a dish from different sources: e.g., seasoning first with salt and finishing the dish with Parmesan. 'Layering fat' could be adding butter to the first stage of cooking, then olive oil near the end. I find this use quite intuitive (and distinct from 'combining') because the order matters—i.e., cooking in oil and then adding butter is different from the converse. The key is that different sources of an ingredient type can be added at different stages, each adding nuances to the flavour and texture. ",

I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring.   The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.

That is common to occur with certain fruits, especially squashes, and especially at the stem-end, as you're showing in your picture.

Unless it's soft, moldy, or otherwise showing signs of rotting, it's probably fine to eat. Cut the ugly bit(s) off and discard just before using... or otherwise the newly exposed flesh will exude more sap! It's probably got some temporary protective properties against fluid loss.  With fresh (summer) squashes, at room temperature, they'll start to get starchy and soft rather quickly.

Garlic (like onions and other members of the allium family) begins to undergo chemical changes the moment you cut into it.  It's the same phenomenon that causes you to tear up when you cut into an onion.  Quoting liberally from Wikipedia's article here...     The phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged [...] The resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time.   Ever notice how garlic becomes sweeter and far less pungent with even a brief sautee?  That's due to the instability of these flavorful compounds and how they break down when cooked.     A large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic. Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the \"hot\" sensation of raw garlic [...] The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness.   If you're defining \"quality\" as how well the preserved product maintains the same characteristics and flavors as the fresh version, this is already quite degraded.  It may still have its uses but don't expect this to be even remotely substitutable for fresh garlic.  Is it safe to eat after a full week?  Possibly, but very difficult to verify at home.  @rumtscho's comment nails it: if this was sufficiently dehydrated, it might be okay (in which case it will be even further from fresh garlic in terms of flavor and usage) but that is unlikely, and this should be treated like any other cooked food.  If you want to maximize the shelf life of your garlic, just keep it whole!  Unpeeled garlic will keep for weeks if kept cool and dry, and you can break off individual cloves as you need them.  All that it takes to ready one for cooking is a heavy pot to smash the clove with and a quick pass with a knife. ",

Three to four months is reasonable in tightly-sealed freezer bags. Longer in vacuum sealed bags. The storage time is entirely a flavor thing, so you can get away with a little longer for strongly-seasoned meat (e.g., tacos) vs. lightly seasoned (hamburger).

The problem is that my results are not consistent. The first time I made them, they were perfect - they tasted just as though they'd been fried. The second time, they were way over-cooked. And the third time, I could not get them done enough, even after nearly tripling the cook time.   Here's what I'm doing...   Remove wings from refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking.  Preheat oven to 425 F. Pluck out any feather bits remaining in the wings.  Use a knife to separate the full wing into little drumstick pieces (one length of bone) and little wing pieces (remaining two lengths of bone).  Line up the pieces on a baking sheet. I didn't have very much space between them. (Is there recommended spacing?) Bake for 45 minutes. Toss with desired hot sauce (I used Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce).   Does the cook time change depending on how many wings you're cooking? Is there a certain size wing that works better? Should I be making sure the wings are room temperature before baking them? I can imagine endless factors that could be causing my poor results.   EDIT: I'm not deep frying b/c I don't want to buy another appliance - my kitchen is about as big as the monitor you're looking at. Maybe a little bigger, but not much. Anyway, it's about having space for appliances. ",
        "output_1": "The key to oven-cooked chicken wings is, basically, don't rely on the oven to do all the cooking for you!  It won't get them anywhere near crispy enough.  Bake too long and they'll dry out, too short and they'll be soggy.  You can't win that way!  Here's how I prepare \"baked\" chicken wings.  Once I learned this preparation method I never went back, not even to frying!   Pull out your steamer or steaming basket. While your steaming apparatus is coming up to temp, split and trim the wings as you normally would. Steam the wings for 10 minutes.  Don't crowd them - make sure you allow for proper airflow.  Steam in batches if necessary. Get out a cookie sheet and cover it with something to catch any drippings (paper towel is fine).  Then put one or two oven racks on top and lay the steamed wings on that.  You need this to allow the grease to fall, and you need the cookie sheet covered below the rack because if you let those juices fall directly onto the sheet, they'll boil and burn during the baking process and leave a nasty bitter taste. Season the now-moist wings on both sides (while on the rack, on the covered cookie sheet).  A liberal amount of salt and pepper is the foundation.  For general flavour, I generally add garlic powder and paprika as well.  If you like a smokier flavour, substitute smoked paprika, and if you want hot wings, add some ground hot pepper or chili powder (I like to use approximately equal amounts of cayenne, ancho, and chipotle). Place the entire rack as-is in the refrigerator and cool for at least one hour.  This is crucial, it will help to \"set\" the wings, locking in the juices and seasoning and making for a much crispier and juicier result at the very end. Preheat the oven to 425° F (220° C). Remove the rack from the refrigerator, remove the paper towel covering the cookie sheet (don't forget to do this!), and place in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn and bake for another 20 minutes.  It may seem like this is going to dry them out.  It won't.  It will crisp them up perfectly.  You'll see. While you're baking the wings on the second side, start making the sauce.  Your basic hot wing sauce (which should be hot \"enough\" but still tolerable for most palates) is equal amounts of Frank's red hot (not the wing sauce) and melted butter.  The butter serves two purposes; it cuts some of the heat (for those who can't stand it) and it helps to bind the sauce to the wings when you mix them, helping to bring together all the flavours and prevent sogginess.  For more heat, just up the ratio of Frank's to butter. Add your own twists to the sauce as you like; I like to do this with additional garlic & smoked paprika, sage, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and a thickener (usually corn starch).  But that's just one of a thousand recipes; some people stick to the basic hot sauce, other people add an Asian twist... this is entirely up to you. Make sure you've got the sauce up to a nice smooth emulsion and then toss the wings and sauce together. Serve with chopped carrots and celery, blue cheese dip, and plenty of beer.  ",

        "input": "I am really interested in theoretical fundamentals of ice cream making. Everyone who is a little sophisticated whith homemade ice cream knows, that the are certain ingredients and ratios that have to be satisfied to make good ice cream.   In fact understanding the theoretics of ice cream making and knowing how to calculate the ratios of ingredients helped me getting my ice cream perfect every time.   A big influence on texture and storability (in terms of hardness when storing the ice cream in the freezer) has sugar.  Sucrose is the most common used sugar, but other types used are lactose (from milk products), dried glucose syrup, dextrose and inverted sugar syrup   They all have influence on the freezing point of the mixture. The lower the freezing point of the ice cream mass, the softer it is when it comes out of the freezer. The sugars also differ in sweetness, which is measured relative to sucrose (1.0). Lactose (0.3), Dried Glucose Syrup (0.5), Dextrose (0,75), Inverted sugar syrup (1.25)  For this reasons a part of the sucrose is often substituted by dextrose, since you can use more of it (to have the same sweetness) and increase dry mass and lower the freezing point.  My chemistry skills are nearly non existent, so my question is how can I quantify the influence of different sugar types on the freezing point of my mixture? I want to determine how much Xylitol I must use to get the same results (in terms of freezing point) as when I used sucrose. To get to the meta level: How can those figures be calculated (I guess it involves molar masses, oh boy!)  Some figures for the sugars above and also Xylitol and Erythritol would be appreciated.   Criteria for an accepted answer:   Must name a measure for influence of sugar on freenzing point on a mixture Must give figures for all mentioned sugar (alcohol) types. Nice to have: A way to calculate the figures Can use basic math and chemisty   OR: Explain why this isn't achievable (for a non chemistry expert)  ",
        "output_1": "As already mentioned in comments above, this is quite a complex mixture with equally complex set of properties to balance. However, if you are just looking at it as a simple binary system with water as the solvent and various sugars as solutes, one at a time, then there is a very simple answer (not necessarily useful alone).  For dilute solutions, freezing point depression is primarily driven by the solvent and not so much the solute, and the relationship is linear. For sugars,   Freezing Point Depression (°C) = 1.86 * M  M is mass/molecular-mass of whichever sugar you use in 1000ml of water. For your example of 10g of sucrose in 100ml water, M is 0.29 and your freezing point is minus 0.5C.  For disaccharides like sucrose and lactose, they have identical molecular mass of 342. For simple sugars like glucose and fructose (dextrose is just d-glucose), it is 180. For inverted syrup, you have a mixture. For polyalcohols, you can look up their masses easily.  I would still advise against using this sort of tool alone for icecream making.  Separately, sweetness is less about just dry mass but molar concentration, which is why inverted syrup is sweeter than sucrose, 1 unit of sucrose in the same amount of water is less sweet than if it was broken into their constituent mono-saccharide glucose and fructose; instead of 1 unit of sucrose, you have 1 unit of glucose and 1 unit of fructose, double the concentration. ",
        "output_2": "People who formulate ice cream professionally have a relatively simple method for handling the math. It codifies the more advanced math in user 110084's excellent post.   Basically every ingredient is assigned a sweetness value (called POD) and freezing point depression value (called PAC). These values are relative to sucrose. A gram of sucrose in a 1000g batch of ice cream has a POD and PAC value of 1. 100 grams of sucrose has a value of 100. And so on.   Every water-soluble ingredient has a PAC value, based on its molecular mass. Every ingredient with a perceptible sweetness has a POD value. Relationships are linear, so you can just create a simple spreadsheet using basic arithmetic.   The system is imperfect, but good enough. It doesn't not account for increased hardness you get from ingredients that increase the water-to-solids ratio. And it does not account for added hardness you get from some non-water-based ingredients. Like cocoa butter and nut oils that can be hard as a rock at freezer temperatures. I've compensated for this by assigning (estimated) negative PAC values to these ingredients. But this isn't really precise.   Nevertheless, the goal here isn't to do analytical chemistry or to make ice cream that's perfectly consistent in the eyes of lab instruments. We just want a simple, predictable method for getting ice cream qualities into whatever range that we prefer. This system is effective for this purpose.   I've posted some related information here: https://underbelly-nyc.blogspot.com/2016/05/sugars-in-ice-cream.html and here: https://underbelly-nyc.blogspot.com/2017/03/ice-cream-solids-water-ice.html  Soon I plan to post some updated information, including possibly putting a spreadsheet online.

Sure, some flavor will remain in the bones for prolonged boiling, but it will be less, and it won't be the same flavor (some tastes will cook out sooner than others). In short, the process which creates scum is the same which creates stock; you can't have one without the other.   In your home kitchen, you can mostly live with cloudy stock if you don't feel like skimming. Clear stock is more desirable, but you can keep that for special occasions.

Start the ventilation and open a window or door.   Put on your gloves.   Use the Plasticine to create a dam about .25″-.5″ high around the area in the oven you’re looking to remove the aluminum from. The areas you’re working in should be about 2.5″ in diameter.   Pour some of the Drano into the dam and add enough water to touch all the sides of the dam. If the chemical reaction hasn’t started (should be almost instant), keep adding the Drano bit by bit until it does. The dam contents will start to boil and ammonia fumes and a little hydrogen gas will form, hence the need for some good ventilation!!   Once the reaction is done, poke around with the wood skewer to see if the oven bottom is clear. If you’re satisfied with the results, add some some vinegar to help neutralize the solution a bit, then use the wood skewer to remove the Plasticine dam to a dish to be rinsed off ASAP.   Use paper towels to wipe up the mess on the bottom of the oven. See your results! The area of the oven bottom you treated should be free of aluminum and just be discolored instead. Not from the Drano, but from where the Teflon bonded.   Repeat the process until the oven bottom is clean.   To get a ‘feel’ for the chemical reaction and what to expect, experiment first!

        "output_2": "OK, to clear up some things here. The first thing: whatever you do, you will not have a shelf-stable product you can keep in the pantry. If you want to make that, you will have to follow a known-safe recipe with sufficient acid and sufficient sugar and proper canning procedures. It will still have lots of sugar though.   Let's assume that you don't need something shelf-stable, just a fruit preparation with little sugar in it. The expensive commercial \"low sugar\" jams are not diluted at all. They simply contain much more fruit than the others. So there is no way you can replicate them by starting with high sugar commercial jam.   So your options are:    Cook jam from scratch to the consistency you want. High-sugar recipes are shelf stable, mid-sugar ones need refrigeration once opened, low-sugar ones only hold for a few days in the fridge. Here you have to use the thickener suggested in your recipe.  Don't make jam from the fruit. If you want very little sugar and have to give up the convenience of preserving the whole thing, just use fresh fruit puree.  Eat commercial low-sugar jam with something else. OK, you can in principle cook a water-based pudding (that's what starch+water makes) and add the jam, but it is probably tastier to add it to pudding made with milk, or to yoghurt.    You cannot really reprocess commercial jam well. It is thickened with pectin, which cannot be re-thickened after heating. It is also sensitive to the amount of sugar and acid, so adding more pectin and water will probably produce something weird. And in the end, if you find some thickener which produces a texture you like, the product will neither be as shelf stable as proper jam, nor as sweet as proper jam, which for most people would not be worth the effort. If you really want to try, pectin should be the thickener to go.  ",

As far as safety goes, the lye is consumed in many reactions, including the above.   (Firstly: The equation source was not the basis of my answer; rather it was to refresh my memory of the reaction about which I was told/read several years ago was the reason why lye is safe to use on leavened breads, which was its combining with carbonic acid. (I apologize for not checking the balance adequately.) My recent search only found one reference at The Kitchn to the reaction of lye with carbonic acid as the reason for its safe use. It is also unsourced. Simultaneously, I found a research paper and a Food Chem Blog entry which referenced it, both of which discussed the behavior of the lye bath on pretzels. There is a lot there, so I shall only quote the paper abstract:      The effects of alkali dipping on starch, protein, and color changes in hard pretzel products have never been researched. Experiments were conducted to mimic reactions occurring on the pretzel dough surface. Dough was dipped in water or 1% sodium hydroxide solution at different temperatures between 50°C and 80°C. Protein and starch profile after dipping were analyzed. Color development on pretzel surface following the extraction of pigments from flour was investigated. Whole dough and pretzel samples were also made at pilot plant and the properties were analyzed. Only starch granules on the dough surface were gelatinized following dipping. Amylose-lipid complex dissociated at a lower temperature with alkali treatment but were not dissociated, even at high-temperature dipping in water. Treating the dough at 80°C in alkali solution resulted in the hydrolysis of proteins into smaller peptides that could be not precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Dough surface color was different following pigment extraction from flour but not significantly different following baking. The results suggest that the color that developed on pretzel surface was not due to pigments present in the flour but was contributed by the reaction within or between the starch and protein hydrolysis derivatives during baking.   and what I think is the pertinent quote from the blog:     The protein results (2 in the list above [reproduced following]) indicate that the lye dip provides the smaller proteins needed for Maillard reactions, whereas the water dip does not. This seemed like perhaps the most important point to me.         The dip resulted in the hydrolysis of protein into smaller peptides. This happened a little bit in 25°C water or lye dip, more in 80°C water, and a lot more in 80°C lye dip. Also, the smaller peptides in the hot lye dip had the smallest molecular weights; most of them “walked off” the electrophoresis gel, leaving no bands. The authors explain that the alkaline conditions of the lye dip result in like charges along the proteins, which repel and cause the proteins to unfold; this makes them more susceptible to hydrolysis.      Both the blog and the paper are worth reading.  My conclusion: the lye is consumed by the various reactions and therefore poses no safety concerns. ",
        "output_2": "The references noted above have mostly looked at the specific chemical changes to the constituents of the dough and the species in solution.  A few point to the Maillard reactions as a contributor to what is going on.  It is worth noting that the Maillard reactions are quite complex and involve a lot of intermediate products. However, in many cases the rate limiting factor is the pH of the constituents. It is possible to accelerate the reactions by raising the pH, and more Maillard products are produced if you let the process run for an extended period of time or raise the temperature which further increases the reaction rate.  Some people don't believe that you can get the reaction to go at all at temperatures below 300°F, yet adding a little baking soda to a batch of onion soup and pressure cooking it (265°F) for 40 minutes will yield the same browning that much longer cooking of the onions produces in the classic technique.  So increasing the pH by using lye (pH 13) vs sodium carbonate (pH 10) vs sodium bicarbonate (pH 8) will facilitate a dramatic speed up the Maillard reaction rate, and subjecting the pretzel to high temperature in the oven will carry it out.  What happens to the NaOH to detoxify it is most likely a combination of neutralization, dilution, and chemical conversion through interaction with other available species.  I would not recommend eating dough dipped in lye without baking the dough first.  I am intrigued by the notion that the high pH breaks down the proteins into shorter amino acid sequences which facilitates the Maillard reactions but does not affect the rate constants. ",

The ratios of cooked weight to raw weight, and cooked volume to raw volume, depend a bit on exactly how you cook the rice. The nutrition facts are based on some average of \"properly\" cooked rice.    If you do cook things in excess water, then yes, there is some very small amount of nutrients in the water (it's still water, not a protein shake), hard to say exactly how much, and if you're determined to get every last bit of nutrition you can eat it. For rice it's generally a non-issue, since you don't need excess water - just use the right amount and it'll all boil away or be absorbed. Beans are generally cooked with a bit of excess water, but they don't need an insane amount, so it's not hard to turn that into a soup/sauce for the beans, and so there's still nothing to throw out.

So in this case the cooked peas simply just have less peas and more water. So if you cooked 1 cup of raw split peas you'd still have about the same nutritional content, but more mass and volume from added water. Taking into consideration what Jefromi said, and the fact that some nutrients degrade in heat, I'd say you're barely denting the nutritional content by cooking and rehydrating it, you're just creating more volume and mass to eat,but all that added mass/volume is simply water.  Its also worth noting some nutrients don't get absorbed as much when you don't cook the food. This is mostly just for carbs and proteins, which neither degrade with heat, but rather break down into more digestible components.  Still vitamins C, A, B6, and many more degrade from excess heat and water(and even light and oxygen exposure). One way I can think of to prepare these foods without heat is to crush or mill them to a powder to reduce the surface area and then add just enough water to get them to digestible paste.

The picture illustrates my suspicions, which is the difference is the surface area (ignoring of course mineral content and different types of grinding salt). Standard table salt is a compact little cube, effective when it’s to be dissolved in a liquid, but not so much when it comes to direct contact with the taste buds. Place one cube on your tongue and you get 1/6th of the surface area in contact, meaning, a lot of salt without much saltiness.  Sea salt, with a more rectangular shape is closer to 1/4th the surface area touching your tongue. Ground salt is more like shards of glass, so nearly half of the exposed area could be in contact making things taste that much more salty. Also with a much finer texture, you are left with many more particles in a wider area, meaning, a saltier taste with less salt.    It’s a good way of finishing a dish when the salt is going to be lightly dusted on top or mixed with an oil where it will not dissolve at all.

Oil helps to increase the effective area of heat transfer, jut like it does in any sort of frying. You can toast nuts without the oil, but you have to be extra vigilant about keeping the nuts moving so no one spot gets too much contact with the pan. Of course, adding oil also adds the flavours of the oil - usually one would use a neutral oil to toast nuts in, but if you were looking for a specific effect there'd not much stopping you from toasting in something distinctive. In terms of protecting the nuts from oxidation, a coat of oil  will technically block oxygen from getting to the nuts themselves, but all that achieves is that instead of the oil in the nuts going rancid from oxidation, the oil in the coat of oil goes rancid first, which isn't any better from an 'I'd like to eat this' point of view.

It is a myth that Alcohol or Acid make the meat tender.  In fact, they have the opposite effect.  Per food author Harold McGee's quote:     Alcohol does denature and dehydrate meat and fish tissue, and the   stronger the alcohol, the stronger this effect.   What you should do instead, is to cook off the alcohol from your marinade first. The ingredient that keeps the meat juicy is salt which most marinades have.  The less acidic marinade (beer versus wine) the more tender the meat.  However, some not so acidic wines end up flavouring the surface of the meat enough to provide a pleasant byte. ",

        "input": "TL;DR Is synthetic astaxanthin safe for humans to consume? Background Synthetic astaxanthin is available as a supplement, and is also commonly consumed by humans in the form of farmed salmon. Wild salmon eat a lot of shrimp-like krill, which contains lots of astaxanthin, which is what gives salmon it’s red/pink flesh. In farmed salmon, they’re not fed the same diet, so they don’t get the same colour (they’d be grey or off-white). So farms feed them synthetic astaxanthin to give their flesh a red/pink colour. This says that humans that eat the farmed salmon end up consuming the synthetic astaxanthin via the salmon's flesh. I found the following:  An article saying:   ... one company has announced it will bring a synthetic astaxanthin supplement to market for human use. Their argument for its legality is that it’s already approved as a color additive in food (salmon). This may be a legal loophole that could potentially bring this far inferior supplement onto health food store shelves sometime in the future. The question that remains to be answered is whether or not synthetic astaxanthin is safe for direct human consumption.   Astaxanthin may cause stomach pain in large doses (but so do many foods in large quantities).  Also:    Synthetic astaxanthin is significantly inferior to algal-based astaxanthin  Note that being 'inferior' doesn't imply that it's unsafe.

It is lipid soluble, accumulates in animal tissues after feeding of astaxanthin to rats and no toxic effects were found [15,17,133] ... Supratherapeutic concentrations of astaxanthin had no adverse effects on platelet, coagulation and fibrinolytic function [139]. Research has so far reported no significant side effects of astaxanthin consumption in animals and humans. These results support the safety of astaxanthin for future clinical studies.  Additionally, yeast-grown astaxanthin is currently being researched as a dietary supplement because of beneficial effects on the heart, eyes, and tissues, and may contribute to beneficial weight loss.

It takes time for the heat to penetrate the meat, which is why sous vide is classified as a \"low and slow\" method of cooking.  Because your package is frozen, in order to bring the meat up to temp it has to thaw first, which takes even more time.  Depending how thick the package is, if you pull it out in 15 minutes it is entirely possible that the inside will still be frozen.  If you cooked the meat sous vide in the first place, an merely wish to use 200 degree water to reheat it, you will over-cook at least the outside of the package, again depending on the size/thickness.  If you cooked it in a more conventional way, its still possible that you will overcook it by using such a high temperature, as even chicken (which is usually cooked very well done) is only cooked to an internal temp of 165F.  Regardless, I would definitely expect some loss of quality if you reheat by boiling.  In order to preserve the quality (tenderness, juiciness, flavor), your best bet is to reheat gently.

The tomatoes don't get hotter than the other ingredients. But they do have a tendency to burn more than certain other substances, so the question is \"Why?\".  You get burned when a portion of your flesh reaches a high enough temperature{+}. The food warms your tongue, lips, etc. by heat conduction until either you move the food or your mouth parts and the food reach the same temperature (a condition known as thermal equilibrium). What that common temperature is depends on the amount of heat (i.e. thermal energy) in the system. Some of the factors that come into play are:   How much (mass of) food there is. How much (mass of) your mouth is involved (see below). The initial temperature of the food. The \"heat capacity\" of both the food and your mouth parts, which is a property of each substance that appears as a coefficient in the thermal equilibrium equation. (Don't worry, I'm not going to make you read any math.) Water has a (very!) high heat capacity, so watery foods tend to drive high final temperature and thus to burn you more easily. There is an added complication for the extra heat needed to establish a phase change (i.e. melt solids or vaporize liquids) called the heat of fusion or heat of vaporization. Again water has a high value for both of these numbers.   How fast the common temperature is reached depends on   The area of contact between the food and the mouth. Another coefficient called the thermal conductivity. This one is complicated, but liquids tend to have a high thermal conductivity and solids less so. This is where soups, sauces, and melted cheese really get you. Note that your mouth parts has a pretty low thermal conductivity, so you only get to count the surface layers in finding the equilibrium temperature. Sorry.   Some consequences of all this:   This is why you can peel the aluminum foil off of a pan that has just come out of a 400 degree (F) oven without trouble, but if you get your hand stuck in the steam plume (which is only around 212 degrees F) you get scalded: Aluminum has a low heat capacity, and steam has a (very, very!) high one. Small bites help in two ways: less total heat means a lower common temperature, and may allow you to move the food around in your mouth, reducing the temperature of any one part. Some foods are just dangerous this way. You know what they are from experience: steam, hot soups and sauces, melted cheese, etc.   {*} Well, sort of. But take that as true for any particular region of any particular dish. {+} What temperature is that? Good question. Maybe there is a medical professional around, 'cause I don't know.

If you want to maximize flavour, you need to realize that you will only be able to taste what went in and an older bird, possibly even one that lived free-range and had a varied diet will have developed mature muscles and denser bones than what is - basically - a half-mature bird, raised in a short time on a less varied diet and in a sheltered environement. On a first glance, a stewing hen might look scrawny, the skin and meat will be darker and the fat more yellow and of a more intense flavour than what you are probably used to. Also note that for maximum flavour those chicken parts that are often discarded in Western cuisine (because they have little meat) are an excellent choice, from neck to wingtips and feet, gizzards and hearts. The meat, on the other hand, might be tougher than what you are used to (ymmv) but very flavourful.  But if you only have access to young birds and your goal is the stock, let me suggest a more frugal aproach: buy whole birds for your standard everyday cooking, chop them up yourself, use breasts and legs as usual and collect the carcasses and other trimmings for stock. A chicken breast from an 8-weeks old bird is delicious on its own, but pretty useless if you want to make stock. Again, adding extra necks, feet, gizzards if you need more chicken makes sense. If your standard store doesn't offer them, check out Asian stores, for example. ",

What we do is use chicken gizzards, either boiled alone or added to a chicken stock pot. (We pre-cook gizzards for frying.) The stock from gizzards cooked alone is amazingly close to that from a stewing hen, with possibly even a little more depth of flavor.  ",

If the cheese was acidified with a bacterial inoculation then the bacteria will have converted some of the lactose into lactic acid which will both be in the whey. Riboflavin is water soluble and is what gives the whey that greenish tint.  Either way- most of the nutrients that bacteria like are not in the whey and it is always highly acidic. I have personally kept whey for a couple weeks with no ill effect.  I usually use my whey soon by making ricotta. If the cheese it came from didn't denature the albumin in the milk then you can gently heat the whey until the the albumin precipitates out.

I usually bake a batard shape, with 80% hydration. I make a single score, using a kitchen knife, about 0.5 to 1 cm deep cut straight down. I spray the oven walls three or four times with a plant sprayer after I put the loaf in.  What can I do to get better results? Should I invest in a razor, should I angle the cut a bit more?  Since the answer is a combination of the things mentioned, I'd thought I'd edit the question to summarize my findings. I've tried most of the things mentioned below. The following things stand out:   It's perfectly possible to get a  properly opening score without a lamé.  There's a spectrum ranging from doughs that immediately open up when you cut them, and those that stay firm and re-seal immediately. This mostly depends on hydration. If you have the first, you'll want to make very horizontal cuts. This gives you a kind of flap that holds the cut closed long enough to keep it from hardening during the first minutes of the oven spring. This is why the score looks asymmetrical after baking. I resisted the method of putting a dutch oven inside my oven for a long time. I have a small oven and this reduces the effective space a lot. Also I can't watch the dough spring anymore, which I find the most magical part of baking bread. But I tried it and, holy cow, what a difference it makes. Of all the tricks mentioned, this one made by far the biggest difference.  ",

Frankly, although I did it for years, I don't find the plant sprayer method to do very much -- and if you're opening the oven periodically to spray in the first few minutes, you could be losing significant heat that could actually reduce oven spring.  I concur with the steam pan method or using an enclosed pot.  Note that pots don't have to be cast iron: any enclosed pot will significantly improve your crust as long as it is oven-safe at the baking temperature.  That said, I think this particular problem is difficult to troubleshoot without observing your specific loaves and slashing technique.  Slashing deeper (whether vertically or horizontally) is definitely NOT always the answer and can actually deflate your loaves significantly if done incorrectly.  With proper hydration, shaping, and oven steaming, it's very possible for quite shallow slashes to lead to great expansion.  (As an aside, serrated knives are also about preference -- if you don't keep your straight-edge knives very sharp, serrated may be a better choice.  However, they can leave your slashes jagged on the final loaf, which may not be as pretty and may result in unevenness for shallower cuts.  I keep some of my straight-edge kitchen knives really sharp so they can be used for things like this.)  A lot of it depends on shaping and the stage of proofing your dough is in when you bake it, as well as the hydration.  If you do a very thorough shaping (i.e., preshaping, bench rest, then very tight shaping of the final loaves), the outermost skin of the loaf may be very taut.  Even a shallow slash could be enough to allow the loaves to open up significantly.  If, on the other hand, you do a very gently shaping (little or no pre-shaping, trying very hard not to deflate the dough at all), the \"skin\" will not have the same characteristics and deeper slashes may be necessary.  (As an example of this, you might consult the different advice given by Peter Reinhard and Jeffrey Hamelman -- the latter emphasizes detailed and tight shaping and thus advocates very shallow slashing; the former encourages gentle handling when shaping and advocates somewhat deeper cuts.)  The stage of proofing is also critical here: a loaf that is somewhat underproofed will likely have a more taut skin but will also hold its shape better even with deeper slashes.  If the loaves are somewhat overproofed, they have a better chance of deflating or at least losing height with deeper slashing.  The apparent moisture of the dough and its susceptibility to \"reseal\" the cut will also change depending on proofing stage.  Again, there are a lot of factors to consider.  I would pay particular attention to the behavior of the loaves right after you slash them.  Do the slashes spread significantly immediately (indicating a taut surface)?  Or do they just remain close together (and thus risk re-sealing)?  If you slash more deeply, does the loaf deflate?  And if it does so, does it seem to reinflate in the oven, or do your permanently lose height?  These observations can help troubleshoot the exact issue.  A final concern -- sometimes if the dough is likely to reseal, waiting too long between slashing and getting the loaf into the oven can be a problem.  A few seconds should not be an issue, but if you're taking a few minutes to slash and load a few loaves before getting them to the oven, that can be enough time for some cuts to close up again. ",

        "input": "I spent about 2 1/2 years as a lacto-ovo vegetarian but, I gave up eggs in October. The problem is that I really like cake. Unfortunately, the cake recipes that I've found that don't use eggs produce very dense cakes. Is there a way around this? ",
        "output_1": "There are substitutes, but eggs have very important effects on the texture of dough and are therefore hard to substitute. You will need to experiment a great deal until you hit on the correct texture, because you'll need to tweak all other ingredients and maybe include new ones, e.g. substitute part of the butter and use cream instead to account for moisture loss from egg substitutes.   Mien's link already includes some substitute ideas, like applesauce and commercial imitations. I can't give you more suggestions, because I always put eggs in my cakes ;). But when tweaking, keep following in mind:   Egg whites provide a resilient mesh which traps small air bubbles, so they make a cake more airy. You may need to adjust the baking powder upwards a bit. If it is a soda recipe, you'll need to raise the acidity too. But the whole effect can't be approximated just with baking powder, because its bubbles are too big. For that, you need better emulsification (covered below).   Egg whites also have a binding quality. This shouldn't need compensation in a cake, as you need a dough without too much binding (as opposed to bread), but if your cake starts falling apart, consider using a flour with higher gluten content (all purpose flour instead of cake flour). Gluten binds too.   If, on the other hand, your cake is too bread-like, then you may need less binding. The egg yolks are a source of fat, which prevents the dough gluten from forming a strong mesh by covering the particles. You will miss this with egg substitutes, especially if they are pectin-based (like applesauce) because pectin enhances binding. Use the lower gluten dough (it it doesn't cause the cake to fall apart) or add more fat.   Then there is the importance of emulsifiers. Egg yolks are one of the best sources of lecithin in the kitchen. An emulsifier helps your wet ingredients bind in an emulsion, instead of staying in two separate phases with the watery phase soaking the flour through and the fatty phase making the whole thing greasy. It also helps the trapping of very tiny air bubbles in the wet part of the dough (this is what happens when you beat eggs with sugar on high speed until the colour lightens) which provides a very fine leavening. Maybe commercial egg imitates contain emulsifiers - check the list - but if they don't, you must buy pure lecithin. It is usually soy derived, but maybe you need to check with the manufacturer that your brand is suitable for vegetarians. Also, consider including cream, the fat in it is already emulsified in water, unlike butter (which is water emulsified in fat). You must calculate precisely and tweak other ingredients to ensure that the total amount of fat and moisture don't change (except if you are compensating for the changes caused by the egg substitute).   If it is a chocolate cake, consider reducing the fat and the flour and adding some cocoa powder (the regular-fat variety). Cocoa has binding and thickening properties, and will help with the more even fat distribution. Melted chocolate tastes good in cakes, but makes them very dense, so don't use it.   The easiest way would be to find a recipe published by someone who has already done all the work. But just from paging through a cookbook, you can't tell if they did it right, or just slapped a spoon of applesauce instead of an egg and called it a vegan cake.   Edit: I just had an idea when I saw Mien's gelatine question and yours together in the list. I haven't heard of anybody using it, and don't know if it will work, but it does, it will be great. So try it.   I already said that using cream would help. As you need a foam full of very tiny bubbles for the perfect leavening, you could try whipped cream instead of whipped eggs. The trouble is that the air will get out of the batter very quickly while and after folding the cream. So you'll need to stabilize it. Gelatine in unusually small quantities will make for a very nice experiment, but obviously not one you'll want to do. But plant-derived gelling agents could help. Carrageenan is commonly used with dairy products, and you can buy it online. So try folding stabilized whipped cream into the batter.  ",

        "input": "So, I'm not a chef and there are few foods I'm good at cooking. Grilled sandwiches, however, I would say are one of these few. Of course, for such sandwiches, with grilled or toasted bread, the crispness of the bread from toasting or grilling is a major component of the food experience. However, I have found that serving a sandwich the standard way, with on bread slice down, often results in a severe reduction in crispness, especially if the sandwich contains meat or other juicy items. Even if the sandwich insides are not so juicy, like for a grilled cheese, the release of water vapor due to the fact that the sandwich is hot, and having it trapped there between the sandwich and the plate, is enough to completely nullify the crispness of that piece of bread.  My personal solution to this is to cut the sandwich, typically diagonally, and plate it with the cut side down, so as to allow the release of water vapor to the air, and to mitigate juices going straight to the bread. I have found this to work quite well, as long as the sandwich is one that basically holds itself together decently well. (a toothpick can help.)  My question is whether this is a known plating technique for sandwiches, where the purpose of such plating is to maintain bread texture properties. ",
        "output_1": "I think this is a perfectly legitimate question. Flat plating of a grilled sandwich will almost always result in the bottom piece of bread being steamed by the time it is eaten. Grilling with thicker or denser bread somewhat alleviates the problem, as well as grilling with a roll sliced and grilled on the cut side.   As for presentation, your method is definitely not unheard of. The comment about the Club Sandwich is point on. You might also consider serving your sandwich with one half of the sandwich laying against some chips or veggie slices (carrot or celery sticks). That would keep the steam from developing under the sandwich. Then place the second half on the plate, barely overlapping the first. Grilled sandwiches are just one of those things that don't hold too long for service.  ",
        "output_2": "If the whole problem is the bottom getting soggy, you can try several things.    consider keeping the sandwich on a cake cooling grille, or one of the smaller pot cooling grilles, even serving it on them on informal occasions.  Alternatively, put the sandwich on a napkin and not directly on porcelain, to minimize condensation and have some of the moisture seep into the paper instead of the sandwich. But this can backfire if the paper is so thin and fluffy that it glues itself onto the sandwich, so choose the napkin carefully.  serve the sandwich on a non-oiled wooden board, it will reduce (but not remove) condensation. Note that if it's a cutting board, the steam will leach food odors, especially stale onion, into the sandwich, so don't use that. If you have a coaster made of flat wooden beads, use one of them on a plate.  if you are serving the sandwich with something on the side, prop it there, either on a slant or even flat with enough support. What you use and how you arrange it depends on the complete ingredients of your meal.    If keeping it vertical works for you, you can surely go on doing it, the food police won't come to arrest you :) But like other posters, I'd be afraid of sliding, it probably doesn't go well with any sandwich.

However, as i was thinking about the heat, i forgot the other crucial element: the sweet.  For me a good chili isnt just kinda hot: It should be perfectly good and hot, but kept in check with sweet. This in particular is why you see a decent habanero hot sauce with lime, lemon etc in it. Normally I add citrus fruits to my chili.

This unrefined sugar can be considered similar to brown sugar in use (I substitute equal amounts jaggery when a recipe calls for brown sugar), but not in composition - there are a lot of mineral salts left in it, because of the lack of refining and absence of chemicals that are usually used to process sugars.

Microbial activity is essentially the number of microbes (bacteria, yeast, mold, etc.) growing on or in some food.  There's no hard rule for saying that some set level of microbial activity will make you sick, but the risk of illness caused by harmful microbes increases as the overall count of microbes rises.  So the expiration date is not a magical date upon which the food is definitively spoiled - it's an estimate of when the food will reach a somewhat-arbitrary amount of microbial activity that's considered unacceptably risky to eat by the producer in question.  Cooking is a form of pasteurization, and it will kill most of the microbes present in the food, so you could consider this a means of \"resetting\" the microbial activity in the food.  However, that has some important caveats:   Cooking does not remove toxins produced by some harmful microbes that can make you sick; if there's a risk that those were present in the uncooked food, then the same risk applies to the cooked food. Cooking damages cell walls and accelerates degradation of the cooked food, causing it to spoil more quickly; the general rule of thumb for cooked foods is about 3-4 days in the fridge.  Basically, once you cook a food it's no longer the same product, and the expiration date no longer applies the same way that it did to the uncooked food.   So, like many food safety questions, this is not a question with a single \"right\" answer - it's a calculation of the risk that the food could make you sick.  There is always some slight risk, and there are many other factors besides the food and its expiration date, such as how you stored the food, whether you (or whoever you're feeding) has an immune deficiency that makes them more likely to get sick in general, etc.  When you ask \"has a food gone bad?\" that must be interpreted and answered as a question of \"has this food exceeded an unacceptable risk for consumption?\" in food safety terms.  Personally, if I felt confident in the safety of all of the ingredients that were expiring, I wouldn't have qualms about a cooked product made from them lasting for another day or two. But, if any of those ingredients were suspect, then they should be thrown out and not used; a dish cooked from them would inherit the same risk as the original ingredients.    This goes doubly for any commercial situation where you are selling the food to someone else; in that case there are specific regulations set by government agencies around the acceptable level of risk.

Butter spreads thinner when melted.  Shortening retains a higher flexibility, and retains air, resulting in a higher rise.  Shortening products are softer.  Butter is used for flavor.  Shortening is used as a flavorless base.  Shortening can be exchanged for butter.  Butter cannot usually be exchanged for shortening.  Butter has uses in the kitchen beyond just baking.    While adding water to shortening might make it somewhat softer, fat and water doesn't in general mix well, so I doubt you'd have much luck with the method which was taught you.

It’s used in preparations where you are trying to control heat and evaporation, for instance poached fruits, onion confit, braises, etc. In these applications, if you simply use a standard pot cover the heat inside the pot will get too high resulting in the food cooking too quickly, turning to mush and not holding as much flavor.

With a paper lid, you don't get that large collection of steam in the air above the dish, so you don't run into those problems.

Some forums are saying that applying a rub overnight may risk removing moisture from the baby back ribs. Is this true?  I plan on smoking these ribs in an electric smoker. ",
        "output_1": "Many people have strong opinions on when to apply a rub -- some say to allow at least a few hours and preferably overnight.  Others literally apply it as they are putting them in the smoker/oven.  Since people do it both ways and both claim to end up with terrific, moist ribs, whatever effect this might have is probably small.  It may change aspects of the \"glazing\" effect that a rub might give, depending on what is in the rub.  A rub left on for a longer period will become more mushy and more like a paste or a glaze/sauce, while a rub put on fresh before cooking won't have time to become as moist.  You will get slightly more flavor penetration with a longer rest, but there are diminishing returns there too after the first hour or two.  I don't have experimental evidence to back this up, but I think the \"early rub will dry things out\" argument is pretty flimsy from a food science perspective.  It is true that rubs which contain significant amounts of salt, sugar, or other hydrophilic substances will cause some moisture to come out of the meat.  On the other hand, most people tend to cook ribs for quite a few hours anyway (and some smoke them for many hours), so the rub will have plenty of time to draw out that moisture regardless of whether you put it on ahead or time or right before cooking.    It's not like you're salt-curing the meat and leaving the salt on it for months.  Once the salt (and/or sugar) draws out the moisture from the outermost thin layer of meat, it generally takes much longer for moisture to migrate from inner parts of the meat.  That surface layer of meat will release most of its moisture within an hour or so after you put salt or sugar or whatever on.  So, even if you put your rub on immediately before putting it in the smoker, that moisture will tend to be drawn out in the first part of the cooking time.  Adding a few more hours or even overnight to the rub shouldn't result in significantly more moisture loss from the meat's interior -- and the exterior will always dry out a bit as it cooks anyway.  Moreover, you aren't generally draining away moisture from the surface.  With ribs, you often have them wrapped up to rest, which means the meat sits in that moisture.  And guess what?  About 10-15 minutes in, the brine produced by the moisture combined with the salt in the rub will begin to break down the outer muscle structure of the meat and cause it to absorb more moisture than usual, so much of that liquid lost will be reabsorbed back into the meat within an hour or so.  (Note that the salt and water are carried back into the meat with some of the other spice compounds which are in the rub, so there is perhaps some flavor advantage to applying the rub at least a little in advance.  On the other hand, again this mostly affects only the outermost layer of meat, so more than an hour or two probably won't make more significant changes in the flavor.)  If you're talking about searing a steak, when you salt it might have some impact, since you generally don't want to time your sear at the point at which moisture is being released at the maximum rate.  But for ribs or anything with a long slow cooking time?  It's really not a big issue.  As mentioned above, the larger effect will generally be what happens to the rub as it sits on the meat for many hours.  You may find that the change in texture there may change the final appearance or texture of the outer surface.  But the idea that the interior will dry out significantly?  It doesn't seem likely. ",

It doesn't cover anything about taste, suspected long-term health effects, and so on. It is not about whether you feel safe when you eat it, it is whether it meets the standards set by a regulation agency.   Degraded fats are irrelevant to food safety. There are people who don't like eating them (and some who don't like the idea of eating them, while eating them every day - they just don't realize that their favorite recipes take the oil above the smoke point) so there is much advice around to avoid heating fats too much. It can have different reasons, such as taste, fear of carcinogens potentially occuring during oil pyrolysis, and so on. But this is not food safety advice.   So, the most direct answer is: it is safe because fat heated to any temperature is safe. (At least pure fat - if you heat whole fish to too low temperatures, it is not safe).     Beside answering the safety question, I want to point out another misconception. When you have a chemical mixture, the matters get complicated. Its melting (or burning, etc.) point is not necessarily melting point of the easiest-to-melt component. I cannot tell you if the fat in the fish undergoes degradation at baking temperatures or not, but just because it would have undergone it if you had had pure fat, this doesn't imply that this also happens when it is incorporated in fish cytoplasm or in a cake batter.    ",
        "output_2": "Foods that contain quite a lot of water don't exceed the boiling point of water until that water has boiled off.  So in bread or cakes that's part of the reason why we get a crust -- the inside is still moist so is limited to 100°C (there's a fair bit of water in butter and eggs; even flour contains some) while the crust dries and the Maillard reaction takes place.  The temperature of the surface is limited by two things: thermal mass (i.e. it takes time for the thin surface layer to heat up after it's dried) and thermal conductivity (heat is transferred from the surface to the inside, which is how the inside cooks).  The oven temperature is high enough for the fats to smoke, and for other forms of \"burntness\" to become apparent, so time is also a factor.  Meat and fish have similar water contents (70--80% is typical in the case of fish), so again the bulk is prevented from exceeding 100°C until it's very dry.  But the goal is often to get the middle up to a safe temperature that gives a pleasant texture, while allowing some browning of the surface for flavour.  Fish baked uncovered may be baked with the skin on, and the skin then discarded anyway, which gives a little buffer against over-doing it at least from the point of view of the surface.  Fish that's baked in foil parcels or enclosed containers is in a micro-environment that heats up more slowly due to the water contained within it, and only thin bits touching the bottom would expect to brown.  So essentially very little if any of the fish (or cake) gets even close to the oven temperature by the time you take it out.  This is all slightly simplified ignoring various effects on the availabaility and boiling point of water. ",

I cannot write up a whole course on food safety here, but here are two facts pertinent to your question.    Shelf stability is a truly binary outcome. Your food either supports bacterial life - which means it is only good for a total of 2 unrefrigerated hours after preparation - or it does not, which means it is good indefinitely and any \"expiry\" dates are a matter of degrading taste. There is no \"slow bacterial growth\" state in which the food is safe for several days or weeks or months, but stops being safe afterwards.    There is a bit of an extra twist with all methods that use reduction of water activity to make a food shelf stable (these include dehydration, or jam cooking): since molds need less wetness than bacteria, your food can become unsafe through mold. This is usually not  included in safety calculations, you just consider your shelf-stable food safe until you visually see the mold, at which point it is unsafe.    You cannot predict whether a given recipe will produce a shelf stable food. The only way to know is through testing.    It doesn't matter how many parameters you use for the prediction, the process is too complicated to be described mathematically. So any recipe which purports to produce shelf stable food has either been tested \"naturally\" (by having been used under unchanged conditions for centuries) or in a lab. Note that you cannot make tests for safety yourself - just because something did not make you sick once, or twice, or 100 times, it doesn't meet the criteria for safety.   So, you cannot just pick any food you like, dehydrate it at some temperature, and declare it safe. Nor can you calculate a combination of dehydration time and temperature which is certain to make it safe. You have to find recipes which are either very specific (e.g. someone created a recipe for dehydrated stew that was tested to be safe, and it will have to cover everything including the exact ingredients, stew cooking method, and dehydration method) or apply to a class of foods with known wide safety margin for dehydration (it is pretty easy to make fruit safe by dehydration).   To answer your question directly:      I want an estimated for how long they are safe    The literal answer here is: 2 hours. For any longer duration, you have to use a known recipe that has been designed and tested for safety, and it is impossible to make up that recipe by yourself.  ",

So, a setting of 400F is often meaningless, unless you are carefully monitoring your temperature with an oven thermometer placed inside. It would be fairly common for your oven temperature to be significantly (as much as 50 F or more) different from your oven setting.

Perhaps not so convenient, if you needed to set a custard in a water bath at a low temperature.  You may also be limited in cooking that requires very high heat.  For example, while you could bake an edible Neapolitan pizza, on a stone, in a 400F oven, you would simply get a better result in an 550 degree oven (and in less time).  So, practically speaking, I think the bottom line is that, with the exception of some specialty items, the limits here are mostly time and convenience, rather than temperature.  You could eat well using an oven that only had a 400F setting. I would say 475 - 500F would be less practical, but then again, if you only had one setting, you would adjust your cooking to the heat source. ",

        "output_1": "Me and my husband cook almost exclusively vegetarian at home, because he simply doesn't like meat very much in general. For the meat we do buy occasionally we value quality over quantity, which tends to get rather pricey and we simply can't afford much of it. However, I grew up on a lot of meat, so at first it was rather hard to come up with food ideas and in the beginning I, too, tried to substitute the meat in the recipes I knew from home. With time I came to realize, that this will just make it harder for me and everyone else and I learned to love my non-meat meals.  This, however, was already answered in another answer. Instead I'm going to get into detail about the recipes, where meat is more in the front and needs substituting.   What you have to think about when adapting a recipe like this: What is the meat accomplishing in this recipe? Is it because of the texture? Because it gives body to a dish? Because it's the main protein source? Depending on this, you can substitute different things. However, always be aware that the dish changes fundamentally when substituting, so you simply will get a different dish, which is not better or worse than the original but different.   For example: In a chilli con carne the meat has different funcitons. The first is of course taste, but we'll going to forgo that for obvious reasons. The second is texture and that's where we'll substitute. You can use tofu or seitan here, but I tend to simply go with red lentils. They have an amazing texture and the resulting product is really amazing. Not to be confused with a real meat chilli con carne of course, but it really can be an amazing dish by itself!  Another example: Burgers. Here the meat is more in the front. However, what I personally want from a burger patty is the smokeiness and savoryness of the grilled meat. I recently found out that I can get a similar (although of course still very different) experience by substituting the meat patty by a grilled cheese like halloumi. It doesn't get soft when heated but remains rather firm. It is amazing on a burger, I can tell you.   Always remember, that you don't have to remove all the meat from your diet. This tends to make people crave it even more and makes it harder to achieve your goal of eating less meat. Just go step by step. With time you will notice, that it is a very natural transition and you'll realize how much more you appreciate the meat you do eat. When I visit my family now I can't believe how much meat they eat. It just seems strange to me today. But then again, I can really appreciate my fathers cooking, because I hadn't had a really good steak in a long time.  ",
        "output_2": "Here's my tricks and tips based on 25 years of being a vegetarian and cooking for a spouse who is not:   Avoid meat substitutes entirely for most meals.  They just don't satisfy, and simply act to remind you of the meat you're missing.   Learn to cook & like cuisines that do not require meat, or only require it in small quantities, including Middle Eastern, Mexican, Chinese, and Indian.  Many cuisines are primarily about vegetables, fruits, and grains, and as such you may even have eaten vegetarian meals from them without realizing it.  Middle American cuisine is your enemy here. Get away from the idea of having a \"main dish\".  It's not an acccident that the low-meat cuisines also tend to have lots of small dishes instead of one big one.  Mollie Katzen calls these \"side-by-side dishes\". Learn to be bold with spices.  While you can't replace the meat flavor, you can add other flavors, and if a dish has 3 Tbs of 6 spices in it, you're a lot less likely to think it needs meat.  Smoked salt also helps. Where meat substitutes do work is the few dishes where the meat is more of an accent and there's an appropriate product.  I've had luck with spicy veggie sausages in a base for gumbo, for example, and \"bacos\" can replace bacon crumbles.  Meat substitutes work best for things where the meat in question was very processed in the first place (sausages, hamburger) and will be heavily cooked. Tofu, Seitan, and Jackfruit can be delicious and useful ingredients on their own, but they do not taste or feel like meat.  They can sometimes satisfy a craving for protein, but really they're better eaten in dishes where they would shine anyway, mostly Asian cuisine (although really you can put just about anything in a taco).  Also, most tofu and seitan you can buy in supermarkets is very low quality, which doesn't help.   Hope that helps! ",

        "output_1": "It seems there is no reliable conversion formula - if you check the websites of mixer manufacturers, they go as low as 1/5 of the time (KitchenAid) or suggest machine-kneading for about 4/5 (Bosch). And I don’t think it’s just because the KitchenAid is so super fast.  The good thing is that the lack of a formula forces you to learn how to recognize a well-kneaded dough. I let you in on a little secret here: if a recipe gives a kneading time, it’s simply an estimation or approximation of how long a user may have to knead to reach a certain stage. Individual technique and even working speed varies so much, that a value like ten minutes is just ballpark number.  When you prepare a bread dough, your goal is to create a gluten structure that will trap the gasses and give you the desired crumb texture. There are two main methods:   One uses mechanical kneading for a “long” time and you can recognize the desired results when the dough becomes very homogeneous, smooth and so elastic that it can be stretched to almost translucent thinness (-> window pane test). That’s what a recipe that calls for ten minutes of kneading is aiming for, so check for that stage when using a stand mixer. The other approach doesn’t knead, but just mixes the ingredients and let the gluten develop over time (-> no-knead bread, stretch-and-fold). But that’s a totally different concept that needs a lot more time. Not the method of your recipe, though.    So in short, if you really need a number (e.g. if you want to set a timer and walk away), instead of finding a generic conversion formula, you could measure how long it takes for your recipe and your machine to get a well-kneaded dough and then use that value in the future. ",
        "output_2": "Really difficult to simply say that it would require x% compared to hand-kneading. Heck, you really shouldn't pay attention to time guidelines when mixing dough at all due to the numerous factors that can have an effect on gluten development (acidity, temperature, hydration, etc.). Do a quick google search on 'gluten window' and you will then know how to judge proper gluten structure.  Once you do it a few times you will be able to do it by eye. ",

        "output_1": "Chewy means undercooked. Most of your standard \"barbecue cuts\" of meat contain a lot of connective tissue. This must be rendered to achieve tenderness. This goes for brisket, pork butt, and ribs, to name a few. If you are using the words \"chewy\" or \"tough\" to describe the texture of your meat, in nearly all cases it has not been cooked enough. Your time/temperature pretty much confirms it.  The best thing you can do is deemphasize time and temperature as your measure of \"done.\" Rather, use a skewer to probe your meat when you think you are getting close. It should slide in and out of the brisket with VERY little resistance. Some people like to wrap in foil a few hours in. This will finish the brisket faster, as you will mitigate the evaporative cooling effect that causes your cooking process to stall. Plus, you can add some liquids and spices to the foil, which adds to the flavor profile of your meat. This is better known as the \"Texas Crutch,\" and there is no shame in using it. Plenty of competitions have been won employing these tactics.  Brisket is a little intimidating because of the small window between \"too chewy\" and \"dry and falling apart.\" But you should probably err more on the side of the latter, as that can be more easily compensated. The real takeaway here is have patience, and look to the meat itself for clues as to whether or not it is done, rather than using a timer and thermometer. ",

If it's been staying together long consider yourself lucky all the other times...this time was what should be \"normal\".  The more particulate such as herbs, mustard, spices, etc. that you have in a vinaigrette the quicker it will emulsify and the longer it will stay emulsified.  The particles of spice and herbs act as physical barriers that help to interrupt the droplets of oil so that they aren't able to coalesce and come together as they can when you have just oil and vinegar/acid.    When doing vinaigrettes by hand using a whisk, start with your acid and add the salt along with anything else, leaving the oil last.  Adding salt to the acid component will help it to better dissolve so you get a truer reading on the flavor.  When it's added last as it's usually written in most recipes: \"season to taste with salt and pepper\", the salt usually hasn't dissolved by the time you taste it and you're much more likely to add too much, resulting in a dressing that's a bit saltier than you might like.  The manner in which you drizzle the oil and manner in which you whisk it when doing by hand, are also important factors.  When whisking vinagirettes by hand, drizzle the oil form a higher level so that as it hits the bowl you have a finer stream that's easier to emulsify.  Also, use a back and forth \"zig-zag\" motion rather than a circular whisking motion.  The \"zig-zag\" motion will allow the wires of the whisk to better break up the oil into droplets and emulsify them with the acid.  Using a circular motion creates a vortex in the center of the acid where the oil tends to pool, resulting in an oily vinaigrette.  The great part of using an immersion blender (aka stick or wand blender) is that EVERYTHING can go in at once.  Use a container that's deeper than it is wide (such as 2 cup liquid measure) so that there's plenty of depth for the liquid.  Garlic, shallots and herbs can even go in whole.  The immersion blender will blend up your garlic, etc. and emulsify the oil with the vinegar.  An immersion blender or a standard blender provide you with a the most stable vinaigrette. ",

Tuna and yellowtail (Japanese amberjack) are generally not a parasite risk, but if you live on the east coast and they call their local species of amberjack \"yellowtail,\" it is a different species that often has worms, though, to my knowledge, it is not harmful to humans (but why risk it?).  The thing about delicious large ocean fish is that they are almost all predators, which means mercury will concentrate in them.  A lot of \"how much\" will depend on local human influence and how far a species of fish ranges. I would imagine east coast/Atlantic US fish, with a lot of the traditional coal-fired power generation, is going to have more mercury issues.  It's best to check with your local state agencies, which will have advisories for which types of fish present mercury risks and at what amounts (larger fish size will have more) and how often the fish can be safely consumed, if at all.

        "output_1": "In terms of sautéing, the simple answer is that using oil is going to let you develop fond, i.e. the tasty brown stuff, on your veggies whereas cooking only with water will essentially boil/steam your vegetables — and perhaps give them a little char, as well.  In cooking, both oil and water are basically just things you use to transfer heat to food. They are both useful in their own way, depending on what you're cooking.  In practical terms, oils/fats can serve a couple other purposes, too, like:   Help extract fat-soluble flavor compounds from ingredients, like herbs and aromatics. Keep things from sticking and burning in your pan. Add flavor.   In a hot pan with only water, your friend was probably boiling/steaming their vegetables — not truly sautéing, in which you really try to avoid steaming. If the water runs low, you risk burning your veggies when they come in direct contact with the hot metal of the pan.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it depends on what the food is and how you're trying to prepare it. There are better ways to steam veggies, but hey, whatever floats your boat.  Cooking for Engineers has an illuminating article on the science behind heat transfer. Learning about the Maillard reaction is also a good read. And others more experienced than myself can tell you a lot more, I'm sure. Hopefully this is a sufficient \"short\" answer. ",
        "output_2": "As I believe has been mentioned in other posts, you really can't saute in water. Saute literally mean to fry in fat. Some vegetables which have a high fat content may saute a little in their own oils if very little water is in the pan, but it is more of a steaming process. The big difference is the amount of heat being used to cook the veg.  Olive oils, at least unrefined EVOO start to smoke and burn at faily low temps 200-250 F.  Refined olive oils can take more heat, but many cooks like to use high smoke point oils too fry or even saute.  Anyway, using water in the pan keeps the pan temperature fairly low, generally around the boiling point of the water (212 F).  You can get it hotter using little water but the water will evaporate quickly and burning may occur. If you add more water, you continually cool the pan inhibiting the mailliard effect.  This is the brownig effect that occurs on food when exposed to high heat. This creates a great flavor on most foods.  While there's nothing wrong with cooking in water, the results are quite different from cooking in oil.  ",

I insisted that the goal was to steam the rice- too much water and it would boil into a soupy pudding.

The water temperature is too high if the water bubbles, and this causes starch to migrate from the interior, to the exterior surface of the rice grains, resulting in soggy, sticky rice.  The rice begins emersed in water, add one tsp of butter, and as the heated water evaporates during the preparation, the final product is essentially \"steamed\" rather than boiled. With this slow technique, you only need 1-1.5 cups of water/ 1 cup of rice. Initially select a high temperature until the steam is seen, then immediately lower the heat to a low-medium temperature, before bubbles are seen.  I use parboiled rice because it has been steamed before being packaged, also contributing to a less sticky final-product. Eat well my friends!  ",

The ratio was one cup rice to two cups of water.   When I got my own place I used the boiling method but chose Basmati rice, as is commonly used in india. This rice has a longer grain and holds its shape after cooking. I tried the boiling method with American long grain rice and found it also worked well. There is no need to measure the water as you cook by timer and taste the rice before draining. It's something similar to how you might cook pasta.  Contrary to what ElendilTheTall said in his answer, when boiling rice you do not have to make careful measurements of rice an water. You put in enough rice for how ever many people and an excess of water. Too much water. You cook the rice in an open pan, so you can see it. When the rice has cooked long enough, you pick out a few grains on your fork and taste them. If they are just soft enough, not too soft, then you quickly drain the water in a sieve or colander and serve. Timing is crucial.  Now, when I move to China, I found a very different kind on rice. It was shorter grained and required several washes before could be cooked. This rice didn't boil well. The unless really well washed, the rice powder in the water turns in into something reassembling wall paper paste. Instead the steaming method must be used. To steam you need to carefully measure the rice and water to get the correct ration. You put on the heat and cover. When the rice has boiled almost dry, you take it off the heat and serve. ",

It's very thin. Some tomato sauce is put in the middle and circled around to just cover the dough. Small shreds (or flat, thin squares) of ham are sprinkled over this, in a reasonable amount which doesn't add significant height. Cut pieces of standard \"champion\" (Agaricus) mushrooms are added, complementing the ham pieces but not \"taking over\" them in quantity nor taste. Standard pizza cheese shreds are added on top, causing the entire thing to still look very thin and absolutely not anywhere near a \"pan\" pizza. It's put into the pizza oven for a few minutes. (I don't remember exactly how long.) The finished pizza has some oregano sprinkled on top from a jar.  It could also be that the cheese is put on before the other \"toppings\". I'm foggy on that detail. The pizza described above is called \"Capricciosa\". If you remove step 4, it instead becomes what is known as a \"Vesuvio\". These two pizzas are what I consider \"real pizzas\". I have tried many other versions, but (almost) none of them taste good at all to me; it seems like this is the \"gold standard\" for what a pizza is. However, Americans (and probably Italians) seem to have a completely different idea of what makes a pizza. At least judging by countless movies, TV series, live streams, videos, cartoons and photos I've seen. Most notably, the USA pizzas seem to be much thicker, what I'd call a \"pan\" pizza, with both way more bread part and fillings/toppings, and seem to never, ever contain the ingredients I mentioned above. It seems like \"Pepperoni\" is by far the most common. That is, little round slices of Pepperoni sausage. While that can be good for sure, it really gives the pizza a very different taste compared to the ham or ham + mushroom kind which I like. I tried to locate a good photo, but sadly didn't find any. These two pizzas (which don't look very appealing on these photos) at least give an idea of what I'm talking about, I suppose:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Pizza_bella_vista.jpg (also includes pineapple and shrimps, so please ignore that) https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Italian_pizza_from_stockholm.jpg (Vesuvio)  Is this \"thin\" kind of pizza, with specifically ham and mushrooms (or ham only), entirely nonexistent in the USA?

In the US, it's less common for pizzas to be ordered by a particular well-known \"standard\" name like \"capricciosa\" or \"pugliese\". A pizzeria will often have its own menu of topping combinations with their own names. Depending on the pizzeria, people might tend to order one of those, or they might be more likely to specify the full set of toppings directly, e.g. \"ham and mushroom\" (definitely not an uncommon combination, and one that would be available from virtually any pizzeria).

If you're actually eating plain pasta and want it salty but as cheap as possible, the first thing you should do is cook it in as little water as possible, and with a lid. This will also reduce your fuel bills (you can reduce them still further by turning off the heat for a few minutes in the middle of cooking). If you use half as much water as before, you could start by adding half as much salt, so the concentration in the water remains the same. To a first approximation, it's the concentration that matters here.  Even if you're eating absolutely at cheaply as possible already, I'd be very surprised if you could save significant amounts of money by using less salt, and if you can, you need to consider the health implications (I won't go into more detail).

In addition, some of the scum will just become reincorporated into the stock via a process similar to emulsion.  Third, boiling induces faster breakdown of proteins and other particulate matter, leaving you with a cloudier end product. This is of course of very little concern for stocks which will end up incorporated into (opaque) soups or sauces.  Of the three, only the first is of any real concern to home cooks.

Get their \"throw away\" starter and use it to start yours. I bought a starter from King Arthur about 10 years ago. Still using the same starter today. King Arthur still sells sourdough starter. Their crocks work well too.  You can start a starter simply by putting out a bowl of water in the summer air. The yeast that's in the air will find its way into the water. You should then add some of that water to perhaps a half dozen jars of water flour mixture. Not every jar will start but the ones that start bubbling are worth keeping and nurturing. It may take a day or so at room temp before you see bubbles. After about two days the mixture will stop bubbling. That's when you need to add more flour/water mixture.  I use King Arthur unbleached bread flour in the light blue bag. Use 1 cup flour and one cup tap water and 1 cup starter. You can boil it if you want but I never do. Just make sure you don't add boiling water to the starter or you'll kill it. Tepid or lukewarm is fine. I don't worry about chlorine, add honey or lower the pH. If your water is unusually alkaline you may need to do something about it but first you would need to know if it's alkaline or acidic. Inexpensive pH test strips are available at pet stores that sell tropical fish, especially if they sell saltwater fish. Running your water through a carbon filter will remove the chlorine (Brita, PUR, ZeroWater). You can boil it too but then you have to wait for it to cool down. Simply leave the water in an open container and the chlorine will evaporate out...not sure how long that takes.  You'll need to repeat this a few times until you get a stable culture. Throw away one cup of starter mixture then add back one cup water and one cup flour that's been mixed together.  When you mix a fresh batch, leave it out on the counter for a few hours. It will double in size so make sure you have a big enough container. Starter over flows are a pain to clean up. From there, put your covered starter in the fridge for 2 or 3 weeks and then rebuild your starter again. I go 4 weeks maximum. Always put a date on the jar so you know when to do the refresh. Starter is like a pet, you have to take care of it and it's a long term commitment.  At 4 weeks, your starter will have a layer of black water on top. In general, don't worry about. The water will contain some alcohol as the yeast give it off as a by-product. When it's time to refresh, just pour off the layer of water. Give it a smell. It will have a sourdough smell. You'll quickly learn what that is. As far as I know I have never had a starter culture go bad. At one time I kept two cultures for white bread and one for rye. Now I just keep one culture for white bread.  When it's time to make your bread, grab 1 cup of starter for your bread and use the other cup to rebuild...one cup starter, one cup water, one cup fresh flour. Keep it simple.  You don't need added sugar for sourdough but some recipes may call for it. Authentic sourdough is much like authentic French baguettes...flour salt and water is all you really need. Baguettes use added yeast instead of the yeast in the starter. FYI, by French law, authentic French baguettes can only contain flour, salt, yeast and water, nothing else.   Over time, your starter, and your sourdough will develop their own special character/taste based on the yeast in your area.   Good luck!  ",

        "input": "Help replacing miso and tamari for health reasons    I am a non-junk-food-vegan for health reasons.  Technically I'm \"whole foods plant based\" (WFPB).  It basically means I stay away from animal products and processed foods (like oils and sugars).  When our family made this change, some of us experienced remission of serious conditions  (like: hypothyroidism, anemia, angina with cardiovascular disease, and one is just beginning to fight diabetes and obesity with the lifestyle. So far so good.--You go Sis!)    But one health problem I had remained: headaches.  Then I discovered I had a sensitivity to tyramine.  Poof!  Headaches and brain fog gone!    But, avoiding tyramine has pushed me to avoid nuts, seeds and anything aged.  Aged ingredients, like many cheeses, vinegar, tofu, dried fruit, are very high tyramine.    I've been able to substitute for some high tyramine items:  • allspice for nutmeg  • lemon juice for vinegar (ok in small amounts)  • butternut squash for sweet potatoes  • very fresh bananas for fully ripe bananas  • blended cannellini beans for tofu (in sauces)    BUT... many of the recipes I have call for aged ingredients to provide that awesome savory/umami taste.  (Tamari and miso for example.)    I have considered substituting Redmond's Real Sea Salt and liquid smoke for tamari.    Is there another (non-nut-based) seasoning that would help?    NOTA BENE:  I know I haven't said what I am using the tamari for. I'm just looking for some ideas to keep on hand.

The recipe I've used (and linked) does contain apple cider vinegar, which might be problematic - I'm not that familiar with tyramine - but I found a list of  vinegar substitutes which are, apparently, amine-allergy friendly.    I think the cider vinegar in mushroom catsup is just needed for acid and a bit of sweet flavor, so I think the substitute from the list (apple juice plus ascorbic acid) should be similar enough to work. Even if that doens't work for you, substituting some of the liquid for lemon juice might help (and maybe apple for the rest, for flavor), as the catsup has lemon flavor from zest already so it should not be an impossible change.

(The second rise can take anywhere from an hour to a few hours, depending on amount and activity of yeast.)  It is possible to shape loaves before refrigeration, but it's more likely to produce an uneven rise or misshapen loaves.  It can also be more difficult to judge when to bake, since the center of a large loaf will warm much more slowly after removed from the fridge.  (If you shape after refrigeration, you can fold the dough a few times periodically to redistribute the heat and warm the loaf throughout more quickly.)  To answer the other part of the question about letting it \"sit on the counter,\" that depends on your room temperature, how fast the dough rises, and other things.  If you try this, you should generally be prepared to de-gas and shape the dough after the long rise, doing your final rise right before baking.  (Otherwise, an overproofed dough could collapse during baking.)  If you're just adding an extra hour or something to the rise time, this is unlikely to cause problems.  If you need to let it sit on the counter for longer and the room is warm, you'll need to decrease the yeast content in the recipe. ",

Here’s what I’m using... Krampouz CEBIR4 crepe griddle, wooden spreader, Krampouz round greaser, 14” long thin steel spatula, 230°C (445°F), griddle HAS been pre seasoned as per Krampouz instruction, using exact krampouz sweet crepe recipe AND have also tried the Pancake-world.com French crepe recipe (both from scratch and made to the exact recipe method including resting in refrigerator). After a lite greasing of the surface I pour the batter on and as soon as the batter hits the griddle the first problem begins which is an almost boiling of the batter. Then upon attempting to spread with the spreader, the batter litterally collects on the spreader creating an impossible to spread clumped mess. Yes the batter is smooth before I begin and yes the spreader was resting in hot water before I begin. This happens every single time. I’ve attempted to adjust the temp down... no change. Attempted to add more milk...same result. If I’m following every last detail about this process to the letter, why in the hell is the batter sticking to the spreader???

",
        "output_2": "I have the an earlier model of this griddle, and have made hundreds of buckwheat crepes (galettes) on it, so here's some advice based on my own experience.  Your answer is in your description: \"After a lite greasing of the surface I pour the batter on and as soon as the batter hits the griddle the first problem begins which is an almost boiling of the batter.\"  The griddle is way too hot.  You need to turn it down more.  If you can't turn it down enough to not get the batter to foam on contact, then you have a defective griddle that's too hot and you should return it.  It's possible that it's too hot because you're letting it sit for a long time with the heat on before using it; for some reason the griddle seems to build up heat as it sits.  In that case, wipe it with a wet paper towel to bring the heat under control.  The correct heat is when the batter sets right when it hits the griddle, but does not boil, foam, or immediately turn brown.  As many times as I've used the griddle, I generally have to fiddle with the heat level and ruin one crepe before I can get it right.  In the model I have, the heat dial is labeled 1-10 instead of with temperatures, and I generally have it set to 2 or 3 ... no higher (so probably 120C to 150C on yours).  Snefel is right that you may also be greasing your griddle too much.  Personally, I grease it with 1 tsp of butter before the first crepe, and not again after that. ",

This is the conclusion of the guy who wrote the book on wood finishing, and I can confirm it from personal experience. You can continue using it for cosmetic reasons, I am personally partial to the look given by flax oil - although there are people who prefer the opposite, because cuts are much less noticeable on unoiled wood. To get real protection on an wooden item, you have to apply a layer that actually seals the wood. The substances which do this well are shellac, nitro lacquers, acrylic finishes and alkydic finishes. While you could use a safe-in-trace-amounts finish on a chopping board, the mechanical action of a knife will soon damage such a layer to a point where it becomes useless. Most people are just not interested in refinishing their chopping board a couple of times per week. As for the source of the myth: Long before good finishes were discovered, people tried protecting wood. Since it was known that wood is most damaged by moisture, they used all kinds of water-repelling substances, such as different oils and waxes, sometimes also natural resins. The protection afforded by those is minimal, but it was all they had - and to the naked eye, it does look like a great protection, since oiled wood has an entirely different appearance, and water droplets pearl on it instead of visibly wetting it. This is a concept that is known in science as \"face validity\" - you look at an approach and your intuition tells you that it must be working, so you are likely to conclude that it works. Scientists try to prove that methods work independently of their face validity, but cooks and woodworkers rarely do so :) And since there is a tradition, which convincingly does something, people continue applying it and promoting it.

        "input": "Mostly, I drink unsweetened tea.  However, on the rare occasion that I get sweet tea, I have noticed that it doesn't seem to cool down as quickly as unsweetened tea.  Is there a reason for this, or am I just imagining things?  I was wondering if it had something to do with the cooling properties of natural sugar, but that's just a  guess.   Typically, I put quite a bit of ice in the tea and I use a straw so I'm drinking from the bottom of the cup.  As an experiment, I pulled the straw to the top of the cup (in the middle of the ice) when drinking sweet tea and the tea felt considerably colder.  Any thoughts? ",
        "output_1": "TL;DR = The sweet tea takes longer to cool down because there is a lot more stuff in it to get cold.  When cooling unsweetened tea, you are cooling almost pure water (the tea solids are negligible). A 12 ounce glass of unsweetened tea has about, you guessed it, 12 oz (by weight) of liquid to cool, or 340 grams (mass).  Southern-style sweet tea (if this is the \"sweet tea\" you are referring to), has a 2:1 ratio (by volume) of tea to sugar. A 12 ounce glass of sweet tea has 12 oz (by weight) of tea, and 5-6 ounces of sugar (by weight - 8 oz of sugar by volume = ~7 oz by weight). This puts the total weight of the beverage at 18 ounces or 510 grams (by mass).  The sweet tea, in this example, has 50% MORE mass than the unsweetened tea! This extra mass will take more time to cool down, because there is a lot more STUFF to get cold. It occupies the same volume, but there are a LOT more molecules to chill.  Compounding factors:   Heat Capacity vs. Specific Heat: A detail to this is that a solution of sugar and water has a lower specific heat (by MASS unit) than pure water, so the total heat capacity of the sweet tea is not quite 150% of the heat capacity of the unsweetened tea, but somewhere between 100% and 150%. Intuition would put it somewhere in the 130%-140% range. Read the physics.SE question linked above for some details on that calculation. Rest assured, however, that the heat capacity of the sucrose solution is higher than pure water. Conductivity: I've ignored the thermal conductivity of the solution, since I'm assuming that the stirring in the tea makes the small conductivity differences between the solutions negligible, but that calculation could be done as well. Convection: Unstirred sweet tea will experience less convection than unstirred unsweetened tea. In the unstirred sweet tea, dense sucrose solution will remain at the bottom while the cold water from the melting ice will sit on the surface (you can actually see this visually if the tea is sufficiently colored). This slows cooling by slowing the mixing of the cold liquid with the warm liquid. In unsweetened tea the cool liquid will sink the bottom, promoting convection and self-mixing. However, convection is a side-issue to the primary point, the total heat capacity of the beverage.   And as a final note, explanations like this really make it obvious how annoying it is that US measurements use ounces for both volume AND weight. ",
        "output_2": "My answer is similar to @SamLey, in that we agree the cause is the higher density of sugar solution water. But I have a slightly different take. TL;DR Convection is reduced in a denser solution, so the cold water surrounding the ice isn't carried away as quickly and the ice melts more slowly.  All the data i've found shows that sucrose solutions have a lower specific heat than pure water so one would expect it to cool more quickly. (But who knows how the actual tea components affect it.)  I think the effect you're seeing is due to the density of the sucrose solution.  Ignoring the tea components, a sucrose solution is more dense than a pure water solution. As the ice cube melts in a pure water solution, the cooling water surrounding the cube sinks to the bottom of the glass and the warmer water at the bottom rises, therefore there is increased heat transfer as the warmer water breaks the bonds in the ice more quickly.  But in the sugar solution, the denser water stays at the bottom of the glass and doesn't rise at all. Without any convection currents to carry the cold water away from the ice cube, it melts much more slowly. Also note this effect is compounded by the fact that the melting ice is making the solution less concentrated near the top, so it is even less dense around the ice as it melts.  Since the denser, warmer water stays at the bottom of the glass, naturally it seems to you that the tea is cooling more slowly. This agrees with your observation that if you move the straw to the middle of the ice, the temperature gradient feels a lot greater than in the unsweetened tea.  EDIT: Experiment?   An interesting experiment would be to use a thermometer to measure the temperature after a fixed time of the unsweetened and sweetened tea with ice without any stirring, and then perform the experiment a second time stirring every 30s or so. I would guess that the constantly agitated sweet tea will cool faster than the unsweetened tea, but the undisturbed sweet tea will cool more slowly than the unsweetened tea. ",

        "output_2": "When they say \"probiotic\", what they mean is that there are microbe cultures present in the kombucha.  It's really nothing more than a sweetened tea which has been fermented by a symbiotic mix of yeast and bacteria.  The odor and distinctive flavor is the result of a low alcohol content and acetic acid (the same acid found in vinegar) produced by the fermentation process.  While these cultures do tend to edge out other bacteria that would spoil the drink and potentially cause illness, it can eventually go bad like anything else.  More to the point, because the cultures are still alive, they'll continue the fermentation process as long as they can, especially once you open the container and start introducing oxygen.  This can throw off the balance of the culture, but it can also just make the kombucha unpleasantly acidic.  Once it gets to that point, it might still be effective from a probiotic stance, but the acid could have an adverse effect on your digestion.  If you keep it sealed and refrigerated, it'll last a couple weeks, but a week or so is probably the effective maximum when you're opening the container frequently.

I got some lye and it is working wonders but it is a bit of a hassle to use it safely, which is non-negotiable. I know lye is far more alkaline than baking soda, but could I simply use a much greater amount of baking soda? Is PH the only variable here? ",
        "output_1": "Yes, the pH is pretty much the only variable - especially in the pairing you are describing, since both are sodium salts. I suspect you may get taste effects if you were to use, say, a potassium-based salt, but that's not relevant here. Since pH is the variable we need, they are not interchangeable. You need a strong base to get a good crust on a pretzel, and if you only use baking soda, with its low pH, you will end up with a crust that is between a pretzel and a simple boiled bagel. Of course, if this result is good enough for you, then you can do it this way and enjoy your food. But if you want the authentic, dark brown, chewy, glossy crust, you have to go with lye. Update For a bit more background: Not every base is created equal. There are many salts which, when dissolved, create a solution that is only weakly basic. They have the chemical property of a \"final\" pH which is independent of concentration - once you reach it, it doesn't matter if you keep adding more and more of the salt to the water, it stays at the same pH. The exact value of the final pH of a base is determined by the ions into which it separates when dissolved. The basic and acidic ions of the salt both have an intrinsic chemical property called dissociation constant. To cite bob1's comment,  For H2CO3 [baking soda] these are H2CO3 <-> HCO3(-) + H(+) and HCO3(-) <-> CO3(2-) + H(+) with dissociation constants of of 6.37 and 10.25 respectively. pH = 1/2(pKa + pKb).  This means that baking soda creates a solution with a pH of 8.31, which isn't very much. Even if you keep adding more baking soda, the pH won't get higher. So there is no way to use baking soda to get even close to the effect of a 4% lye solution, which has a pH above 13 - that's a huge difference. ",

Baking your baking soda first, gets you a pretty close, flavor and color-wise, if you are making pretzels.  It's a good hack for ramen too.  Just spread a layer of baking soda on a sheet pan, and bake at 250F - 300F for an hour.  Cool and use. ",

We put this on an electric hob, with no lid at maximum heat (marked at 6, which is ~10 times hotter than our 5 setting.  From experience, the remaining settings decrease operating temperature linearly). When come to the boil we cover with a lid.   Almost immediately they boil over,  spilling water across the hob. We remove the pan from heat, remove the lid, put the pan back on heat, turn down to setting 3, and wait.  Once at the lower temperature,  we replace lid. The pan boils over.   I know the basic mechanism behind boiling over.  Some agent increases the surface tension of the bubbles, causing many bubbles to form and then boil over. I am guessing that it is the starch. I don't know what factor the lid plays,  as occasionally the pan boils over without the lid on.   Is there anything I can do? Are the pans not clean enough? Not enough/too much salt?

With the lid off, heat is lost at the top of the pan at a rate which is usually sufficient to prevent boiling over.

        "output_1": "   I understand that you can either punch or fold dough before shaping it and both have different benefits.   Just understand what you're doing. During the fermentation process (rising), yeast consumes sugar and starch in the dough and turns it into alcohol, carbon dioxide, etc. That carbon dioxide collects gets trapped in the dough (thanks largely to the gluten), and bubbles form. Those bubbles (along with good flavor) are a big reason we ferment dough in the first place, so you want to keep most of them, but you also don't want large bubbles that'll create big empty lumps in your pizza.  \"Punching down\" the dough and folding it accomplish the same things: the idea is to release the gas from the large bubbles, and also to shift the yeast cells around a bit after they've used up all the food that's available in their immediate vicinities. You don't really have to punch the dough with force like you're angry at it, although some people (especially on TV) like to make a show of doing so. You can just press your hand down into the risen dough so that some of the gas gets pressed out. Removing the dough from its bowl and folding/kneading it a little bit does the same thing, and probably also helps develop the gluten a bit.     This recipe doesn’t mention this step, though. Is it just supposed to be understood that I’ll have to punch it before shaping or do they intend that I somehow divide and shape it without knocking the dough down.   Yes, dividing the dough and forming balls will do exactly the same thing as punching it down, perhaps a bit more gently. Forming balls will also give you a nice round shape that'll turn into a disc as the dough relaxes, and that disc will be easy to form into a nicely shaped pizza.  Given the long fermentation time, I'll bet the recipe you're using calls for a relatively small amount of yeast. Between that and retarding the fermentation in the refrigerator, it may be that you won't get the kind of large bubbles of CO2 that you'd get with more yeast and shorter rise time, and without large bubbles there's no need to punch down the dough.     Also, would I punch the dough down twice? Once when dividing and again right before shaping?   No, there's no need for that. Shaping the pizza will break any large bubbles. Sometimes large bubbles will start to form as you're shaping the pizza, or even after you've put it in the oven, and it's fine to pop those with the tip of a knife if you want to. ",
        "output_2": "Expectations for \"shaping\" can vary a lot in a recipe.  Years ago, I tended toward a minimalistic shaping routine, degassing as little as necessary just to get rid of large bubbles and form the dough into the rough shape I wanted.  (This was, for example, the gentle shaping promoted by Peter Reinhart, based on the idea that gentle shaping would lose less gas and thus bring lift to the final dough.)  Then I read Jeffrey Hamelman's book, which devotes an entire lengthy chapter to various shaping techniques.  I followed his detailed diagrams and instructions for shaping various loaves, and I discovered more aggressive shaping usually resulted in a higher rising dough, even if I was degassing more.  I was both strengthening the gluten significantly and redistributing the yeast better.  I see little benefit for degassing (\"punching down\") for the sake of degassing.  You don't need to deliberately try to squeeze air out of the dough, and being too aggressive about it can be counterproductive.  However, I would suggest more purposeful shaping for a better final product.  Many people see shaping as \"roll the dough into a rough ball, and then you're done.\"   But that's not what most professional bakers think of as \"shaping,\" which is an involved process that can require several stages.  Shaping is more important with free-from bread loaves, but it can also have a significant impact on your pizza dough in terms of how it stretches, how it rises, etc.    Personally, after retarding in the fridge, I shape pizza balls pretty aggressively through repeatedly folding dough in on itself in my hands to stretch the exterior.  For best results, I'd also recommend a pre-shaping, where you roll the dough into loose balls and shape a bit, then wait 5-15 minutes until the gluten relaxes somewhat, and then shape again more aggressively.  In the process, you'll degas the dough plenty for what you need to do. ",

Traditionally, this was done by mixing snow or   powdered ice into the dough, which then evaporated during baking.   Today, the dough, which must contain a large amount of water, is   cooled and mixed until bubbly.      Another method is to knead the dough   under pressure in an extruder. The sudden drop in pressure then causes   water to evaporate, creating bubbles in the dough.   Presumably knäckebröd was only made during the winter months before its production became industrialised. For the modern home cook, the difficulty of introducing structure still remains, so it is unsurprising that you didn't find many recipes with very basic ingredients.  Some recipes for home cooks introduce structure in the form of seeds and whole grains. Others, as you noted use yeast.  Some Swedish crisp breads such as tunnbröd, have no leavening, no gas incorporated into the dough and are wafer thin. These can be made at home with a very short ingredient list, no specialised equipment and during any season :-)  At least some of the major Swedish manufacturers do use yeast.

But there are three common objections: (1) it will \"overwork\" the fridge, (2) it will heat up other food in the fridge to unsafe temperatures and cause it to spoil, and (3) somehow, the uneven cooling of the hot food in the container will cause it to spoil. Let's take these each in turn.  \"It will overwork the fridge\" — False in most cases  Lots of people worry about putting a quart or two of hot food in their fridge, but they wouldn't think anything of filling their fridges with multiple gallons of room temperature drinks to chill them, even if it might require the same amount of energy to cool.  Anything that is above the temperature of the fridge will require energy to cool.  Now if you plan on putting a very large amount of hot food into a small fridge all at the same time, it might strain the fridge. If you do it once in a while? Probably not an issue in a modern fridge, as long as it's not excessive. If you plan to do that on a regular basis, you should consider using ice baths or other cooling methods to pre-chill the food before putting it in the fridge.  It will cost more energy to cool hot foods in the fridge. If you are looking for the most energy-efficient method, it is probably to use a cold tap water bath, replacing the water a few times to bring down the temperature as fast as possible to room temperature. Then refrigerate.  Chilling with ice water is safer and faster, but it's not the most energy efficient, if that's your concern.  Also, in most cases it probably makes sense to wait until the food actually gets into the \"Danger Zone\" (below 140°F or so) before refrigerating; there's little safety benefit in putting a boiling pot directly into the fridge. Unless you're monitoring the temperature of your cooling food, though, it still is safest to move it to the fridge as soon as you can.  \"It will heat up other food in the fridge to unsafe temperatures and cause it to spoil\" — False in almost all cases.  This is the real myth that comes from the icebox theory. In an old icebox, you just had a block of ice, and no air circulation. If you put something hot in there, the ice would melt, the food wouldn't even get cool, and everything else would warm up and spoil.  That just doesn't happen in a modern fridge, as can be found out on reputable food safety websites, such as mentioned above. I've actually tested it myself. I once put a gallon of very hot soup in the fridge just to see what happened. I checked the fridge every 30 minutes or so by measuring surface temperatures of other foods with an infrared thermometer.  My fridge is generally around 35–36°F.  There was one item which was almost touching the metal pot that maybe reached 44°F or 45°F for a short time—above ideal refrigeration temperatures, but hardly enough to cause a lot of spoilage. All other items in the fridge—even many on the same shelf—stayed within a few degrees of the refrigerator temperature, 40°F at the most.  And this wasn't in some fancy fridge: it was actually at least 10 years old and a rather cheap model. The air circulation is enough to keep most other foods cool, unless you're actually touching them to the hot container. The radiative heat coming off the hot container will raise stuff around it by a couple degrees for a couple hours, but in a fridge kept at a proper low temperature, this should not be an issue at all.  If you have a very old fridge that doesn't work properly, or some weird new fridge that is super energy-efficient and doesn't cool properly, you might have an issue. But for anyone with a normal modern fridge, this is not an issue.  EDIT: Another question was posed in response to my comment here, and I documented there a more detailed experiment I carried out by placing a gallon of boiling water directly into my home refrigerator (admittedly a newer model than in the last experiment).  My results, in summary, were that even food items placed within a couple inches on the same shelf of the pot of boiling water were only heated by 3–4° for a few hours.  Other items in the fridge (on other shelves, etc.) barely changed temperature, moving maybe a degree or two at most.  These temperature fluctuations might be a minor concern around highly perishable foods like raw meats, but it is probably common sense to keep raw meat away from hot food and warm food in general.  Other items in a well-functioning modern refrigerator are unlikely to be negatively affected. If you don't believe me, here's another documented similar experiment with a large hot cheesecake put directly into the fridge from the oven.  \"The uneven cooling of the hot food in the container will cause it to spoil\" — Certainly false, compared to room temperature cooling.  In fact, leaving your container out on the counter at room temperature has a much, much, much higher probability of causing faster spoilage.  With some dishes, it is actually quite irresponsible.  There's a common belief that cooked food is \"sterile,\" and by leaving it out with the lid on, it won't get contaminated.  But there are a lot of microbes that produce spores which can even survive boiling or near-boiling temperatures.  Many of them are kept at bay by competing with other microbes during the initial cooking phase, but after cooking, all that's usually left are nasty spores.    Rice, for example, is commonly infected with Bacillus cereus, which forms spores that aren't destroyed during normal rice cooking.  Leave a rice dish out on the counter for too long, and you'll start growing a lot of that stuff, which can produce persistent toxins that won't be destroyed during reheating.  This sort of thing is actually the cause of a lot of food poisoning from eating things like leftover Chinese food: if the rice was cooked earlier and not held above 140°F, and then was allowed to sit in a take-out container for many hours, it could grow a lot of toxins.  It's often more likely to get food poisoning from the leftover rice than from a lot of other dishes that might seem more \"dangerous.\"  Rice and Bacillus cereus are just one example.  You really want to get food down to refrigerator temperatures as quickly as possible after cooking.  Don't just leave it on the counter.  If you have a large quantity of hot food, break it down into small containers, and then refrigerate. Not all stacked together though; let air circulate around them.  Or put your pot into an ice bath or cold water bath.  Stirring periodically in an ice bath will make it cool even faster.  It's true that in a large pot of chili or something, the temperature of the center of the food will go down much more slowly and potentially could allow bacterial growth compared to outer layers.  That's the reason that large pots of food should be broken down into small containers.  But note that leaving a pot of chili out on the counter will make this bacterial growth even worse than if it is refrigerated immediately.  Even if you don't do any of these things and leave all the hot food in one large pot, it's still a safer strategy to put it directly into the fridge rather than leave it out on the counter at room temperature.  Important Edit: For large quantities of hot food, I am NOT advocating the practice of placing a large container in the refrigerator.  It may take WAY too long for the large pot to cool completely, and the food in the large container may be unsafe to eat.  Either break it down into smaller containers or use an ice bath.  However, it's still unlikely to harm the food in the fridge or the fridge itself unless it's in direct contact with the hot container.  And it's still safer than leaving the food on the counter to cool. ",

My go-to method has quickly become pressure cooking, since it's relatively quick and it allows me to set the timer and forget about cooking for a while. The problem is that my meat frequently ends up being greasy, occasionally up to the point that it's nearly inedible.  The Info: I'm using bone-in boston butt roasts, between 3 and 5 pounds. I typically cut it into three or four pieces, and brown them before cooking. I pressure cook (using an 8 quart InstantPot) for 110 minutes, then let the pressure release naturally for about 20 minutes before opening the pot and shredding the meat. I shred it in the juices at the bottom of the pot (usually just a few tablespoons of broth/liquid smoke is left after cooking, along with a bit of rendered fat).   The meat is always super tender and shreds easily, and I have no complaints as far as taste or texture. It's just so damn greasy! I can't eat more than a few bites before feeling sick.   I'm looking for;  1.) How do I correct this BEFORE cooking? Different cut of meat? Should I trim it more? Cook it with some other ingredient?   2.) How do I correct this AFTER cooking? Is there something I can add to either remove, or mask the greasy flavor?   So far I've been liberally using a vinegar-based bbq sauce to cut the greasiness, and keeping my dryest red wine handy to wash the flavor out of my mouth. Can you think of any better options? ",
        "output_1": "   So far I've been liberally using a vinegar-based bbq sauce to cut the greasiness   You're on the right track here. You want to add some kind of acid after cooking to cut through the greasy, gelatin-y mouthfeel. With BBQ pork, you'd commonly use vinegar (preferably cider vinegar) as the acid. You could use it plain if you want the meat to be unsauced. Or you could make a \"finishing sauce\" which also includes typical BBQ sauce ingredients like brown sugar, molasses, and spices. Actual BBQ sauces, particularly the Carolina styles which are heavy on vinegar, are just extreme examples of a finishing sauce.  For something like carnitas, you might use citrus juice as the basis instead. The pressure-cooker carnitas recipes that I've seen usually call for orange and lime juice, for example. ",
        "output_2": "I doubt that your meat is really greasy. If it is really overly fat, you will notice it when buying it, your meat will be marbled through and through. But it is difficult to get such meat nowadays at all, since it is rather expensive to produce.   The mouthfeel you describe is more likely to come from the gelatine. When you make pulled pork in the pressure cooker, you are converting the connective tissue to gelatine, leaving the overcooked muscle fibers swimming in it. When warm, it is really slippery, and the meat slides around in it - this is exacthly what makes for proper pulled pork that shreds. And making gelatine from collagen is not that easy. Traditionally people tried to convert as much as possible by very long cooking times, but using high pressure is much more efficient. So it is likely that you are ending up with more gelatine, or better hydrated gelatine, than with traditional cooking.   The first thing you can try to do is to just learn to like it. There is nothing inherent in greasiness which makes people sick eating it, that's a learned aversive reaction, which can be unlearned. With the knowledge that it isn't actual fat, that reaction can subside or disappear. You can try some mindfulness meditation on some bites of the meat to get accustomed to the mouthfeel too.   If you insist on reducing the sliperiness, you might have to make your process less efficient. This means going to a more traditional stovetop recipe without pressure. I don't know if your exact InstantPot model can cook in slowcooker mode without pressure, but if it can, you can keep the convenience of set-and-forget. You will probably have to live with other changes in texture though, not getting such a nice separation.   Gelatine loses its gelling strength with low pH. So you are on the right way with sour sauces. You can try to marinate it with them, and keep a sour sauce in the pot while cooking it, not just adding it at the end. But then you will end with more of a braised meat, which you might not like.   In general, it is difficult to give more advice, because this is exactly what makes your pulled pork good pulled pork. Anything you do to disrupt it will lower the quality of the texture you get.  ",

It's not that the entire thing is 'grainy', the texture is pretty much what I'd expect...it's just a few small crunchy bits mixed it.

What you're trying to do is form very small sugar crystals which provide fudge with its fine texture.  Those crunchy bits you describe are larger crystal formations which can happen if you have a \"seed crystal\" remaining in the fudge as it sets.  The purpose of stirring the fudge very well before pouring it into the pan is to deliberately form small crystals and break up any larger ones.  If you didn't really thoroughly stir even just a few small patches of the fudge, some seed crystals may have developed there.  The clumps you describe in the initial mixture should have dissolved, but working them out would make sure that everything is evenly distributed.  You can add the butter to the original mixture for the same reason instead of waiting until the end like the linked recipe recommends.  A little bit of corn syrup will help control crystals too.  Lastly, stir the fudge like crazy and scrape down as much of the work bowl as you can while you go.  If your arms don't feel like they're about to fall off afterwards, you probably should have mixed it more.  Regarding temperature, remember that when simmering your fudge will carry over a couple degrees even after you turn off the heat.  So you can kill the burner when your thermometer reaches 235F and monitor until you hit the target temp of 238F.

I use it as a safe disinfectant for items such as a retainer. Given that vinegar is typically viewed as a food, I thought that it would be appropriate to pose this question to Seasoned Advice. ",
        "output_1": "See related question on Skeptics, which is basically a continuation of the original of this answer: https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/38472/was-a-package-of-mcdonalds-dipping-sauce-just-sold-for-almost-15k EDIT: Was the 1998 Mulan sauce a mixture of McDonald’s sweet-and-sour sauce and barbecue sauce? The world may never know. But since Rick and Morty has endorsed this cooking video from Binging with Babish (the endorsement is here in the description), and I suspect the makers of Rick and Morty are pretty cozy with McDonalds, maybe Babish knows something the rest of us don’t. In the video, Babish mixes two parts McDonald’s sweet and sour sauce with one part McDonald’s Tangy BarBeQue sauce. He declares it not bad, but not as good as the following: He really likes the sauce he made from a recipe from a Reddit user, who created the recipe with his father in an attempt years ago to duplicate the Mulan sauce. The video doesn’t give measurements, but luckily I was able to track down the original Reddit post  and the recipe.  •  Mince 6 cloves of Garlic and sweat (heat them up in a skillet) •  add 4 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar •  add soy sauce to taste (DO NOT USE LOW SODIUM SAUCE) •  add 2 tablespoon Plum Sake (Drink additional 3 oz Plum Sake) •  Reduce sauce slightly (Drink additional 1.5 oz Plum Sake) •  3 1/2 tablespoons cock sauce (Sriracha) •  add 2 tablespoon brown sugar •  Red pepper flakes to taste •  Minced Ginger to taste •  Consume remaining Plum Sake Simmer that shit for a solid 5 minutes, stirring pretty much constantly. The brown sugar helps it keep the proper consistency, so it's important to use. Play around with the recipe to your taste. Might want more or less balsamic vinegar. Might want more or more Plum Sake. I'd definitely recommend you make it several times to figure out your own flavor.  The rest of this answer is as it was before I knew for sure that the Mulan sauce package in the news recently was a hoax See https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/38472/was-a-package-of-mcdonalds-dipping-sauce-just-sold-for-almost-15k TL;DR According to the labels on the sauces, the answer to your question is no, McDonald's Mulan SzeChuan Teriyaki Dipping Sauce is not a mixture of McDonald's Sweet and Sour Dipping Sauce and McDonald's Tangy BarBeQue Dipping Sauce. I say that because because the sweet and sour sauce lists \"apricot purée concentrate and/or peach purée concentrate\" as its third ingredient. The Mulan sauce does not list that as an ingredient at all, so the Mulan sauce doesn't contain the sweet and sour sauce.  That should be it, right? This is where it gets weird. The first thing I looked for was a list of ingredients for the sauces. I couldn't find that as text anywhere, so I looked at images of the actual sauce containers. I quickly saw that I wasn't going to have any problem reading the ingredients from pictures of the packages. I choose the first two images randomly. Notice that they're from completely different sources.  From: TheEater.com And  From: Mouthful of Sunshine There are two very weird things here. These are supposed to be pictures of the Mulan sauce package and the BBQ sauce package, respectively. The ingredients on both packages are identical:  High fructose corn syrup, water, tomato paste, grape vinegar, distilled vinegar, salt, soy sauce (water, wheat, soybeans, salt), food starch- modified, spices, dextrose, soybean oil, natural smoke flavor (plant source), xanthan gum, caramel color, garlic powder, cellulose gum, dried chili peppers, malic acid, natural flavors (fruit and vegetable source), onion powder, sodium benzoate (preservative), succinic acid  But that's not even the weirdest thing. Got your tin-foil hat? Look closely at the two images:  They are the same photo of the same package, with different sauce names Photoshopped in and the color manipulated. Now that my mind had been totally blown, I looked for other images of the packaging of the sauces that didn't seem to be manipulated. I figured one of the packages above listed the wrong ingredients. Well...  From Popsugar.com and  From An Immovable Feast Full-sized, you can read the ingredients on both. They are identical to the other two. So, either (a) McDonald's had a massive labeling error that would have cost them millions if caught at the time, or (b) the Mulan sauce is actually made from the same ingredients as the BBQ sauce, in the same order of quantity (so, very likely identical sauces), or (c) something is afoot. I am going to get to the bottom of this with McDonald's, I am starting an email campaign now. For the sake of completeness, the sweet and sour sauce contains:  High fructose corn syrup, water, apricot purée concentrate and/or peach purée concentrate, distilled vinegar, soy sauce (water, wheat, soybeans, salt), salt, food starch - modified, dextrose, soybean oil, xanthan gum, spices, sodium benzoate (preservative), natural flavors (fruit, vegetable and plant source), garlic powder, cellulose gum, dried chili peppers, malic acid, onion powder, extractives of paprika, succinic acid   From Craveonline.com This video gets into the lore of the new-found interest in McDonald's Mulan sauce. The video repeatedly refers to the Mulan sauce as only available for a limited time. Hmm. Scratch the surface of the \"Mulan\" name, the BBQ name might be underneath. I suspect that the reason the photoshopped image exists is that it was used in a pitch, showing how easy it would be to fool people into thinking that McDonald's created a sauce, available for a limited time only, to tie into the Mulan movie. EDIT I just noticed this!:  Now I'm really at a loss.  Even Time missed that date. A new Mulan movie is scheduled for 2018. Is this whole thing a marketing gimmick? The Mulan sauce had been discontinued for a very long time by 2011. I tried to read the copyright date on the picture of the container in the hand, but couldn't. The printing looks suspiciously like the photoshopped C2011 package, but it's either not the same package or it has been further Photoshopped since the lower left hand corner is clearly different. I find this whole thing very mysterious, so I will continue the investigation. I think I'll ask the folks at Skeptics for some help with this. ",

The first of each of these missing ingredients contributes the primary flavor of the sauce. Meanwhile, both the BBQ and S&S sauces are missing Szechwan's ginger and (roasted) sesame seed oil, as well as the larger amount of vinegar, the key flavor components for that sauce.  Based purely on the ingredient lists for all three sauces, even taking into account what may be a \"modernized\" recipe for any of the three, Szechwan sauce cannot be a blend of BBQ and Sweet and Sour sauces.

Ruhlmann). You can make other types of cake - angel food cake, chiffon, genoise, etc - and not add icing, they are differentiated by the type of batter only. In other languages, there is a difference. In German, the ones without icing are called \"Kuchen\", and the ones with rich, decorated icing are called \"Torte\" (and usually seen as a subset of Kuchen\"). But in German, a pie is also considered a type of \"Kuchen\", so this is more of an umbrella term, even though the standard thing someone pictures upon hearing the word \"Kuchen\" is some kind of iceless cake, usually on the lines of a marbled Gugglehupf. But in English, there is no special term for a cake without the icing. In some sources, English speaking authors use a category for the opposite of what you are asking. However, it is not centered on the baking attributes of the cake, but rather on its purpose - I have seen authors create bookchapters called \"celebration cakes\", \"wedding cakes\", \"birthday cakes\" etc. It is implicit that they place the richly decorated cakes in these categories, while the plainer ones stay as \"everyday cakes\", in UK sources sometimes as \"tea cakes\" or even get no special name at all.

        "input": "I made a pizza dough with a recipe containing: 20 ounces of wheat, 2.25 teaspoon of Salt, 1/2 teaspoon of active yeast, 12 ounces water.  After a good time of kneading, I let it rise for around 2 hours. Then I made balls. Already I could tell the dough was very humid and bubbling. I let the balls at room temperature for around 10 hours and after, when trying to shape them, they are way too sticky.  Unless the recipe has an issue, is there any tip for handling sticky doughs for shaping pizzas? ",
        "output_1": "I agree with previous answers that the stickiness is probably related to the long second proof at room temperature.  I know because I often make use of a similar technique, though I use a higher hydration dough. Thus, it's probably close to as sticky as yours, even though I don't proof as long.  After a first proof overnight (or for a couple days) in the refrigerator, I remove the dough from the fridge, cut into balls and shape, and then proof for 2-4 hours at room temperature.  While I generally aim for 3-4 hours (depending on season and kitchen temperature), I have on occasion left the dough at room temperature for as long as 6-7 hours.  The dough can get quite sticky, but the flavor, texture, and oven spring often benefit.  (You do generally need to pop some big bubbles while putting on toppings, unless you like a lot of big charred bubbles on your crust.)  Just as an aside, the first time this happened was by accident when I was bringing dough to bake at someone else's house at a party.  I had assumed I would be baking almost immediately after I arrived, but we ended up socializing for several hours before baking the pizza.  I was concerned that the dough would be incredibly overproofed and might have a strange flavor, but it was frankly one of the best pizzas I've ever made.  So now I sometimes do it on purpose.  It can be done to excess though -- eventually, an overfermented dough will bake unevenly and will lose some flavor notes (as well as potentially gaining an excess yeasty or beer-like taste).   In any case, given your batch size and initial quantity of yeast, this does sound like too long of a room temperature fermentation.  For 12 hours at room temperature total, I'd probably start about 1/8 tsp. yeast, and I agree with other answers that it would be better to do the shaping closer to the end, with the longer fermentation at the start.  Or keep the recipe proportions and retard in the refrigerator for part of the time.  Now, to respond to your main question: how to deal with sticky dough, once you have it?  Partly it depends on how your dough balls were stored.  If you plan on having this situation in the future, I'd highly recommend placing them on quite a bit of flour, like a board with a thin \"bed\" of flour.  This will allow you to get the dough off the surface without destroying all the great bubbles of air that have been created in the long fermentation.  (With \"normal\" pizza dough, you can get away with just oiling the surface or with a dusting of flour, but that's usually not going to work with high hydration or extra-long fermentation doughs.)  In any case, here are some important tips:  (1) Prepare your peel with a larger than usual quantity of semolina or cornmeal.  (I agree with other answers that semolina is highly preferable for flavor and texture reasons.)  Some people try to avoid using a lot because they don't want extra flavors in the pizza, but with sticky dough, you have no choice.  You need to be able to get the dough off the peel smoothly.  (If you don't have these, flour can work, but raw flour isn't the best flavor for the bottom of your baked pizza.)  (2) Whether or not you have the flour under the dough balls already, I'd take a bench knife (or wide metal spatula, if you don't have a bench knife), lay it flat, put a decent quantity of flour on the top side to prevent sticking, and use it to carefully get under the dough ball (likely more like a spread disk after a long ferment) from all sides.  Gradually work toward the center of the disk to free it completely.  (3) Dust your hands well with flour.  Then dust again.  Carefully reach under the dough, and lift it up.  Then gently shake it a bit to get excess raw flour off the bottom of the dough before moving over the peel.  (Most people don't like the taste of a lot of raw flour stuck to the bottom of their pizza.  But with extra-sticky pizza dough, you often can't just use semolina/cornmeal here -- you need something that's going to clump a little on the bottom to absorb some of the excess moisture on the outermost layer, or the dough will stick to your hands.)  (4) Stretching will be complicated with overproofed dough, because it tends to become much more slack as gluten breaks down.  You may find that you don't need to \"stretch\" at all; the task will be trying to keep the dough from ripping apart from its own weight as it stretches itself downward.  (This will be particularly true if you used flour without a lot of gluten, but even bread flour that is well-kneaded can turn slack when overproofed.)  Just work very quickly, holding the dough with your fists underneath, pulling them apart very gently -- if you haven't practiced dough stretching on firmer dough, this is NOT the dough to learn on.  You probably will not be able to \"toss\" it -- just gentle stretching with fists and perhaps thumbs to work near the edge.  (5) At some point, with overproofed dough, you will probably have to drop the dough onto the peel early (before it's fully stretched or in a nice circle).  Don't wait for it to rip: better to drop early if needed and fix it.  As long as you have enough semolina there, you can continue to pick up sides of the dough and stretch it out to a good shape.  Just be very careful to NOT touch the top of the dough, which will inevitably be very sticky.  (6) The dusting of the bottom and the semolina on the peel will help to prevent sticking, but with a very sticky pizza dough, you'll need to shake the peel often while preparing for the bake.  Otherwise, moisture will seep down, bits of the dough will stick, and you'll never get the thing off the peel and into the oven in one piece.  So, you'll probably want to shake at least after every topping addition: put on sauce, shake, add cheese, shake, put other toppings, shake.  If in doubt, SHAKE.  Then shake a final time to be sure it is loose before going into the oven.  (You do NOT want to be surprised when the dough is 1/3 of the way off into the oven that the back part of your dough is stuck on the peel.)  If at any point some part starts to stick, get your bench scraper and some flour or more semolina and get under the dough to free it immediately.  (7) When unloading your dough into the oven, be very careful to pull at a constant rate.  Slack overproofed dough will easily deform during unloading, so you could bunch up your pizza if you slide it off too fast, or you could rip a giant hole in the bottom if you pull back too quickly (which will be one heck of a mess -- hint: go turn your smoke alarms off immediately if this happens).  Assuming you managed to get the thing into the oven in one piece, you're good to go.  If you didn't enjoy this, next time you make pizza, try to avoid the sticky dough problem.  On the other hand, if your pizza comes out so good that your friends rave that it's the best pizza they've ever eaten (as happened to me), consider learning to handle sticky, slack, overproofed pizza dough.  It is sometimes a handy skill. ",

I don't think there is a detailed answer to which cultivar for which sauce, although I would love to read the opinion of a tomato-obsessed person on this.  For salads (I know that is not your question, but you need to recognise this type too when choosing) you would use firmer, less sweet variaties with some more complex, maybe acidic flavours. Do not mix up the two. And because it is generally impossible to buy good, ripe, sauce tomatoes,I would say: go with the advice to use good tinned once.

Also, good quality canned product (whole peeled, or peeled strips) is usually considered superior to fresh, due to them being canned at optimal ripeness which would make transporting them fresh impractical. I found that the cheapest brands often are sloppily peeled and/or not ripe enough and/or too sour, it is usually worth going for the 90 cent can vs the 30 cent can.  Also, do experiment with what part of the tomato you use. You could:  -Use it whole except the stem, and puree or strain the sauce later (does not apply to canned peeled obviously :) )  -Use everything except the peel (will need looooong stewing to deal with the seeds)  -Use the flesh, and also the juice strained from the seeds  -Use only the flesh (lot of tomato needed, and you might lose some of the umami from the juices)  Also, mashing vs pureeing vs straining can make a lot of textural difference.

'(St.) Basil-pie' or 'king pie', see below) is a New Year's Day bread or cake in Greece and many other areas in eastern Europe and the Balkans which contains a hidden coin or trinket which gives good luck to the receiver, like the Western European king cake. It is associated with Saint Basil's day, January 1, in most of Greece, but in some regions, the traditions surrounding a cake with a hidden coin are attached to Epiphany or to Christmas. It is made of a variety of doughs, depending on regional and family tradition, including tsoureki.   According to the article, the coins at one point were often quite valuable...     In older times, the coin often was a valuable one, such as a gold sovereign. Nowadays there is often a prearranged gift, money, or otherwise, to be given to the coin recipient.   Provided the coin is cleaned before being inserted into the dough, I don't know why it wouldn't be safe... coins aren't generally made with dangerous metals like lead and gold coins, as mentioned in the quote above, would be perfectly fine.  You don't say where you get \"nickel\" from... Greeks are on the Euro and I don't believe they use the term \"nickel\" for a five cent coin. They did have a five-cent drachma but it and other modern coins were made of cupro-nickel, a combination of nickel and copper, while others are made of aluminum or silver.     The first issue of coins minted in 1954 consisted of holed aluminium 5-, 10- and 20-lepton pieces, with 50-lepton, 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-drachma pieces in cupro-nickel. A silver 20-drachma piece was issued in 1960, replacing the 20-drachma banknote. Coins in denominations from 50 lepta to 20 drachmae carried a portrait of King Paul (1947–1964)   The coin is symbolic for religious reasons. Here's the story as related on a religious site:     One year, during a time of terrible famine, the emperor levied a sinfully excessive tax upon the people of Caesarea. The tax was such a heavy burden upon the already impoverished people that to avoid debtors' prison each family had to relinquish its few remaining coins and pieces of jewelry, including precious family heirlooms. Learning of this injustice upon his flock, St. Basil the Great, the archbishop of Caesarea, took up his bishop's staff and the book of the holy Gospels and came to his people's defense by fearlessly calling the emperor to repentance. By God's grace, the emperor did repent! He canceled the tax and instructed his tax collectors to turn over to St. Basil all of the chests containing the coins and jewelry which had been paid as taxes by the people of Caesarea. But now St. Basil was faced with the daunting and impossible task of returning these thousands of coins and pieces of jewelry to their rightful owners. After praying for a long time before the icons of our Master Christ and His All-Holy Mother, St. Basil had all the treasures baked into one huge pita. He then called all the townspeople to prayer at the cathedral, and, after Divine Liturgy, he blessed and cut the pita, giving a piece to each person. Miraculously, each owner received in his piece of Vasilopita his own valuables.   ",

In many cases the canister is made of glass. As the linked article says:  French presses with a glass carafe are an extremely fragile type of coffee maker, quicker to chip or break than most. In fact, brand instructions typically advise against using metal spoons when stirring so as not to damage the glass.  A metal spoon used without caution could easily cause minor chipping or scratching in the glass canister. While this might not seem like a problem, a french press is subjected to large temperature swings when the water is poured in. Temperature increases on glass cause thermal expansion of the glass, which subjects it to stresses, particularly where there is a temperature differential between different parts of the pot (e.g. hot bottom, cool top). These can cause minor chips and scratches to catastrophically fail. In addition to this, during normal usage, the filter part of the press is plunged to collect and remove the coffee grounds from suspension. This results in some pressure being applied to the filter, especially if too much grounds are in the canister to be easily filtered out. The pressure on the filter is transferred to the liquid component. Liquids, are incompressible, which means that any pressure applied to them is directly transmitted to anything containing them. Under such pressures the chips/scratches could also cause failure of the glass. ",

So the answer is that yes, serious whiskey buffs would never mix   \"good\" whiskey with anything except a little water (preferably from   the same source the distillery gets their water from).   This is a claim I find intriguing and something I have never previously heard. Can anyone validate this? (or discredit it?)   note: I am skeptical because if there were truth to it I would think one would find branded bottled water in every liquor store.  [Edit/Clarification: When I ask for \"validation\" of this I am looking for more than just 'confirmation' of the claim, but some evidence or rational that explains why it is true. How does using 'the same water' augment the flavor, more so than 'plain' 'clean' water. What does the water used to create Highland Park do for Highland Park that it doesn't do for Jack Daniels? (and does the water need to be as old as the whiskey?)] ",
        "output_1": "I too had never heard of this until I read @user5561's answer. So although it's news to me, I'm going to venture an answer. I believe the \"reasoning\" is as follows:     The overall taste of the whisky will be comprised of the flavour of   the water, the flavour compounds generated by the fermentation and   distillation, and finally the flavour generated by aging the whisky.   Therefore, if you wish to water the whisky down, you should use the   same water the distillery used so that you are not adding additional   flavour components to the final drink. If you use a different water,   you will be introducing flavours that weren't present in the whisky as   it came out of the bottle.   Now there are three assumptions this belief will be predicated on:   There is a human being on this planet with a sense of smell so developed that they would notice the difference. The water you are using will somehow always make the drink taste worse and never complement what's already there. The original flavour components in the water the distillery used have not undergone any changes during the fermentation, distillation and aging.   I take issue with the first two assumptions. You won't be able to tell the difference unless you're using water you just scooped out of a swamp and, with good water, there's no reason to believe it could not possibly improve the drink. I doubt the third but don't have any evidence either way.  I've come across a similar argument used for pizza, coffee, stock, etc... For example, since coffee is mostly water it's the most important ingredient. It seems logical until you realize that the neutral flavour of water is so subtle that it's quickly overwhelmed by just about anything you add to it (especially ground coffee beans). ",
        "output_2": "When making whisky, water is used at several stages; first, it's used in the vat to give the yeast more mobility to fully digest all the starches (and to ensure the alcohol concentration stays low enough to not inhibit the yeast's growth). That water is removed during distillation (which typically produces a spirit between 140 and 150 proof; a traditional open-air still simply cannot remove all the water from the alcohol), and then a little fresh water is added back in, producing a \"cask strength\" somewhere in the 100-120 range. The extra water slows evaporation of the alcohol and keeps the barrels hydrated during the aging; regardless, some of the spirit is inevitably lost to the air (the angels' share) and to the wood of the cask itself (the devil's cut) as the barrel sits in the aging vault. Finally, just before bottling, the cask's proof is tested and the whisky diluted to 80-100 proof for sale in the U.S.; a few distillers also market a \"cask strength\" that doesn't get this last step.  Therefore, the whisky in the bottle contains a good dose of whatever's in the water in the brook flowing by the distillery, typically referred to as \"peat\" as most of the water in that region filters through layers of peat moss before arriving at a stream (and over in the Islay reagion, it's less stream, more peat bog, leading to the quite extreme flavor of whiskys like the Laphroiag).   It's traditional to add a splash more of water to a whisky to \"open it up\"; the whisky loses some of the powerful alcohol sting and displays more of the complexities of its taste (two primary variables in Scotch are a smoky note from the char of the barrel and the earthy peat from the water). Filtered water is generally acceptable, especially across the pond where local water from the distillery is hard to come by, but hardcore Scotch connoisseurs who look for those earthy peat tones unique to the spirit will prefer to add more of that same flavor in the water.

As for the blender, I've never tried it myself, I've found this website that gives a good how-to. It says to chop up the guavas, put them in the blender with some extra water (the amount needed will depend on how juicy your guavas are, so don't put too much with them in the beginning), blend, put everything in a clean towel or a cheese cloth and try to press out the juice, so the pulp and the seeds stay behind. There is nothing wrong with the pulp, you can let it in if you don't want to do the towel-step. But your juice will be more like a smoothie.  A juicer would be less work, but it's more expensive. Perhaps try making juice with a blender, and if you really really like it, you can always buy a juicer if you know you like it.

I have tried this a number of times with (seemingly) good results, but I am unsure if the dehydrator is having an adverse affect on the final product.  I have the 9 Tray Excalibur, and I usually place a bowl of warm water at the bottom, then place a large mixing bowl with a dish cloth over the top on the third tray (just above the bowl of water). I'll turn the dehydrator to 95°F (35°C), and let the dough rise according to the recipe.  When dehydrating fruit/vegetables or making trail mixes, etc., the dehydration time is usually measured in days rather than hours.  From that perspective, I don't think that my breads should be significantly dehydrated during the rising process, but I don't know for sure.  Also, the Excalibur works by 'fanning' the moist air away from the trays inside.  The fan is not forceful, and is not powerful enough to shift a damp dish towel, but it will easily lift a piece of paper towel or similar. As I typically use a damp towel to cover the bowl, I don't think air flow is an issue either.

Use an oven thermometer that you can leave in the bird in the oven, it's much easier than having to pull the goose out and check it every 5 minutes. A handheld one is also useful to back up your measurements in case your leave-in probe is out of position.

As noted before, wheat starches and other starches do this in the steam of the oven. For lack of much steam in a regular oven (though you can do some tricks to create it without a steam injection oven-- google it) the water part of the slurry will become the steam that's in contact with the cornstarch part of the slurry.

If I'm reading it correctly, the general advice on the Le Creuset website even suggests a ride through the dishwasher! I'm worried about ruining the season. It's tempting to dunk the whole thing in warm soapy water and go at it with a scrubby pad but that just feels wrong.  Incidentally, the previous owner abandoned this pan for this very problem. It \"made a mess\" and they \"didn't know how to clean it.\"  Do I just treat it like a regular cast iron skillet?  It makes a tasty burger...

This type of oven will almost always be off from the desired temperature, but +/- 90°F sounds… not good.  You might be able to get the oven to cycle less with the addition of thermal mass (pizza stones or similar), but that also means that it’s going to spend longer times at each extreme. It wasn’t until we got ‘fuzzy logic’ controls that instead of just off/on, they’d do things like ‘set the heating to 50% when you’re close to the desired temperature’ or similar to try to maintain a specific temperature rather than just bounce around near that temperature.  But those require microchips which have been in short supply the last few years.  (If the oven has an LCD screen to set the temperature or even as a clock, it has microchips, but may not always have fuzzy logic) It’s also worth mentioning that there have been reports of some ovens that set a timer for preheating, rather than when the oven is actually up to temperature, so may need extra time when the kitchen is cold.  Adding thermal mass makes this even worse, as the oven might not be close to the desired temperature by the set time. There’s also the possibility of a bad sensor or calibration issue, and the oven is consistently off on its temperature.  This might be able to be adjusted by a technician if it always skews 50°F colder than normal.  Of this is the 90° of error that they consider acceptable, I would be very worried about their products. It’s possible that the 90° is cumulative between those two types of error.  If it’s 30° inaccurate (always cold, for instance), and has a 60° precision issue (swings as it stays near the set temperature), then together they add up to 90°.  But that still seems like a huge error rate to me. You might think that you could get a probe thermometer to monitor this from outside the oven… but from experience I can tell you that a kitchen thermometer often aren’t rated for these temperatures.  They might list ‘high’ when they get significantly above the boiling point of water.  (And they might melt parts if put into a very hot oven (without being in food) for long times) ",

None of these are good, and some are dangerous: bad wiring + high draw appliance = fire risk   I highly recommend getting an electrician in to test your system as it will ensure safety and give you a definite answer as to whether it's a problem with the oven or not.

That is the very reason why a glazing is needed to seal it, in order to make it food safe, if we want to make something, such as a cup, from it. If that ceramic cup were to be left unglazed, it would soak up some of whatever is put into it and we would never be able to clean it all out. Whatever is soaked into the ceramic, would then grow mold, trap bacteria and so become a health hazard.  That is the reason why most health codes require any ceramics used to serve food or drink, to people, to discard crazed ceramics. The crazing (cracks in the glass sealing the ceramic) in a cup, does not give us cause for concern that the cup might break and spill hot liquid onto a person, because that will not happen, due to crazing alone. Crazing is simply cracks in the glazing that seals the ceramic beneath it, thus rendering it a health hazard to anybody drinking from it.  We should be careful to never discount a health code, as rediculous, simply because we may not understand the reason(s) behind it.

Pickled eggs and sausages are out on the counters of some convenience stores and delis for many days. They are heavily salted and in vinegar.  Your pickled ginger is not as aggressively preserved, and is marked 'refrigerate after opening' to preserve quality over a several month period, so put it back in the fridge and it will be fine. Do that a bunch of times, though, and it will degrade and lose quality.  Pickled ginger will probably never 'spoil' in the sense of contamination, but lose quality through oxidation.  We are talking about GINGER here. It is used as an anti-microbial agent. Here is an excerpt from the abstract of this scientific paper:   Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has long been used as naturopathy due to their potential antimicrobial activity against different microbial pathogens. Moreover, in many countries like Bangladesh, ginger is used in different boiled food preparations. This study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of soybean oil extract of dried ginger powder, using agar diffusion assay, against 24 isolates (4 of 6 different types) of food borne pathogens including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Klebsiella spp. and Salmonella spp  Your ginger is fine.

I fried some diced chicken in a little lime juice and olive oil in a frying pan on a medium-high heat. I periodically measured the temperature by sticking the end into the centre of a piece of chicken.  At no point (even after 10+ mins) could I get the thermometer to read above 40 C (whereas it should reach at least 68 C), even increasing the heat had little effect. I ended up overcooking the chicken in an attempt to increase the temperature measurement.  I stuck the thermometer in boiling water to check it was working properly and it indeed gave a reasonable measurement.  Question: Can anyone explain what I may have been doing wrong?  Is there a knack to performing the measurements? Are the thermometers intended for measuring large pieces of meat only? Or did I likely fail to heat the chicken correctly? In which case, what should I do to get the temperature up? Like I said, even on a high heat still wouldn't push the temperature above 40 C. ",
        "output_1": "Here's a technical explanation as to what happened. An analog thermometer works on the principle that different metals expand more than others when heated. There is a bi-metallic strip in the pen part of the thermometer in the shape of a spiral coil, which is attached to a piece of metal which turns the pointer. The outside of the strip expands more when heated and contracts more when cooled than the inside, so when heated the coil will twist the pointer in the direction of the spiral.     As the pen part of the thermometer heats up the coil changes shape and adjusts the temperature. As you can see from the picture the sensitive area of the thermometer is the length of the coil, that entire area needs to be heated up to the same temperature in order to read correctly. In your case what you were trying to measure was too small and had to compete against the ambient temperature of the air.   Digital thermometers work on a different principle entirely, using an electrical device called a thermocouple on the end of a probe.    The bead at the end is the actual sensor, and as it is much smaller it is therefore more precise than a bi-metal coil. However, I still think one of these wouldn't work because again the size of the meat isn't enough to heat the probe's sheath enough for the sensor to read correctly.  ",

Highly recommend something by Thermoworks (Thermapen, MK4 or ThermoPop). They're accurate, very fast and read right at the very tip. (No affiliation, just love the product).  Aside from that, I typically wouldn't use temperature to check whether a stir fried (small dice) piece of meat is cooked. I'd probably just cut one piece open and look for it to be cooked through. If it's small enough, by the time the outside is at the right colour, the inside should be cooked through.

        "output_1": "To back up what I say, I can site lots of articles that said said all sorts of things. Some that made sense, others not. Although I put it all together as such. Some black teas are premium ones (labelled Assam, Ceylon, Darjeeling, Nilgiri, Keemun, Souchong, and Yunnan). Also estate Africa blacks and good grade South/Central American ones which they also have today are good as these are generally orthodox teas. Thiland, Vietnam and Burma also produce higher quality ones. They are called flowery, tippy, golden or othodox. Most places in the world use these with the exception of North America, UK, Belgium, Egypt and some although not all or most middle Eastern countries which use CTCs a lot. Countries using orthodox though tea articles never say it directly although indicate to it if you read lots of other articles to get it -are always satisfied with their blacks.  Blended teas are not always lower quality necessarilty than single leaf estate ones. Common sense says that if you mix decent quality tea you get a decent blend. If the blend contains cheap teas you get a cheaper blend. This is common for general supermarket teas. French Breakfast tea for instance is often made of a higher quality blend. Whereas you can get good English Breakfast blends - most of them use cheaper CTC teas for the bag. This is the case today with British breakfast blends (English, Irish and Scottish) since convenience became more of an issue here. Also Earl Grey is often used in cheaper blends though one can buy expensive ones. Masala Chai blend is probably the cheapest as this is often what the dust grades are used for though they can taste quite good in it. Orange pekoe can follow suit with that although it is possible to have very good ones (flowery grade ones) which are far better than masala and most chai blends are sometimes cheapest even though they put the word specialty on it on a cheap tea set. Most in the supermarkets however are the dust grades. Orange pekoe can also refer to a leaf grade size for certain types of (often Ceylon teas) although at full is a nice flowery-bud tea. Also keep in mind that green and many herbal teas in bags are also usually these days very low quality and bland and some even below the former though I have seen it according to my observations outside  Flowery, (F) Tippy (T) and golden (G) are high end blacks. B means a broken leaf which still can be a good tea, especially if listed after the previous notations or the OP sign. If an F is listed after the B however its likely a less good tea as that means a fannings which is a lower grade. D or dust is the lowest. Flowery golden tippy are orthodox. Broken can be if not a fannings and dust. The latter two are CTC grades. They can however work well IF you want to make masala chai or some sweet iced tea, just for the sake of it. The higher end blacks are loose leaf and have more of a malty brisk flavor yet they take a couple of minutes to brew up. CTC teas brew up faster in the bag which is what people like although they never as good as an estate orthodox one  ",
        "output_2": "Every tea can have potentially various grades and different teas will have different qualities. I'm not sure what is available where you are, but if you're fairly new to drinking loose leaf teas, I'd for starters find a store that lets you see, smell and possibly sample various teas. Once you have a better idea of what you're looking for, then online dealers will be easier to navigate.   So, firstly, find a reputable store, one where they are knowledgeable about their product, and difference in grades. Ask to smell the teas. Please DO NOT stick your head in the tea, waft it with your hands or the lid of the tin. If you like the aroma, it's a good starting indicator of how you'll like the tea. Look closely, are the tea leaves fairly even in size? An unbroken leaf is generally graded higher than a leaf that is broken/crushed. Though since you're specifically asking about black teas, note that certain black teas are deliberately cut, to encourage a stronger flavour. If the leaves are torn, crushed, it may be a sign of a rough machine harvest, or poor handling. This could result in bitterness. The lower grades (small crumbs and dust) generally end up in tea bags. So, note that. Most importantly, taste it! If the store offers a few different sampler sizes, go for that. Ask the people there, about how they'd recommend you prepare it. And try a few different kinds and grades.   Note, if you're new to loose leaf tea, it should taste different than what you're used to. Trust your taste buds and your nose first... Regardless of what it looks like and the price and what the description says, if you don't like the way it tastes & smells (which is often subjective) the rest is pretty meaningless. ",

With pork chops, however, the fat is around the side and so will drip off during roasting, and broiling beforehand will just dry out the surface of the meat. I'd suggest rolling the fat in some salt, then placing the chops fat side down on a warm pan for a few minutes. This will render out the fat.

        "output_2": "Well, it seems you answered your own question, though you then expand this question of fat content to \"quality.\"  \"Quality\" of butter is subjective.  It depends a lot on application.  Higher fat does not necessarily mean better flavor or better performance (particularly as an ingredients in things like baking).  See, for example, this article, which discusses the ranking of butter in a number of applications.  Fat content varied from 80% to about 86%, but that wasn't highly correlated with superior results.  The tasters' opinions there came down in favor of the lower-fat butter for applications like pound cake (where they claimed more steam from the higher-moisture content added to lift) and buerre blanc (where they claimed the excess fat unbalanced the flavors of the sauce).  But I think this is probably more evidence that American recipes are likely calibrated to assume butters on the lower edge of spectrum, around the legal minimum of 80% butterfat content.  Anyhow, my personal experience is that processing matters a lot more than butterfat content.  In particular, I generally taste a strong difference between cultured vs. \"sweet cream\" butters.  And salt content can make a huge difference.  But another thing that came up is storage/wrapping, as fat tends to absorb odors and other flavors, as mentioned in the above article and in a Cook's Illustrated review article that also ranked butters in various applications.  I find it interesting that this article is available on the Vermont Creamery website, which makes a big point of how it has the \"highest butterfat content you can obtain when making butter\" of 86%; even they are posting an article whose title is basically that butterfat may not matter as much as other factors.    (By the way, I'd personally disagree with the CI characterization of cultured butters in general as having \"artificial, margarine-like\" flavors.

        "output_1": "I would not recommend attempting to cook onions on the stove top without oil.  Another answer suggests that it's a bit like grilling; in theory, it is, but a traditional outdoor grill has a minimal contact surface.  That minimizes sticking and makes it fairly difficult to burn food by contact alone.  Using a dry fry pan for onions is more akin to searing, except that you generally only sear meat or fish.  If you try with an onion, you are likely going to burn it before you ever get to the sweated/caramelized consistency you want.  You really have two options here.  The first, and the one I highly recommend, is dry roasting in the oven.  Cooking an onion involves the Maillard reaction and the dry, radiant heat of an oven is great for promoting it.  Simply toss the onion on a baking sheet and roast it inside the skin for about 20 minutes at 450° F / 230° C.  It will peel easily and you'll have a nice, soft, roasted onion.  Don't overdo it or it will burn - the skin will help prevent this but keep an eye on it!  Your other option is to simmer or steam it, which will soften them substantially and cook some of the volatiles out (make it less pungent) but won't brown them because the Maillard reaction requires high temperatures and the boiling point of water is too low.  Simmering should be obvious, just toss it in some water or stock.  For steaming, either use a steamer basket or just put a small amount of liquid in a pan, heat it up to a simmer, place the onion in and cover it until cooked to your desired consistency.  Those are pretty much your only fat-free options.  If you want to use a frying pan and expect to get them browned, then you'd better use at least a little bit of oil.  If you're concerned about trans, saturated or polyunsaturated fats, use olive oil.  If you're on an ultra-low-fat diet, use a blast of cooking spray. If you're avoiding \"fried\" foods out of an assumption that even a tiny amount of oil is unhealthy, I suggest consulting a dietician (if you haven't already) to validate that assumption first. ",

Thinking she meant a bread roll with bacon on it, I said yes.  When the food came, my wife's egg sandwich was exactly what you'd expect. My bacon roll was what seemed to be something similar to an omelette with bacon in it, with a mixture of boiled potatoes, onions, peppers and something other things on the side, plus jam and toast.   So, my questions...    What exactly is an American bacon roll? What is the accompanying vegetable side dish called, and what are the ingredients?   Additional detail: A sausage roll in England is sausage meat wrapped in pastry but bizarrely, any other roll (e.g. bacon, cheese, ham, tuna, etc) is a filled bread roll, so a sausage roll and a bacon roll have absolutely nothing in common. I wondered if there was a similar oddity with the word roll in the US.   The vegetable dish was roughly cut boiled potatoes (not roasted or browned in any way) with cooked onion, peppers, and some other unidentified vegetables.

It isn't even normal for Denny's (which is a chain-restaurant approximation of a diner).  I really do think what you were served as a side was a very poor specimen of home fries. Home fries are a common side for any egg dishes in NY/NJ diners. They are usually diced potatoes with onions and tomatoes and/or bell peppers and often with some additional seasoning. They should be cooked on a griddle/in a frying pan until crispy but they can be started from half-cooked potatoes to speed up the cooking process. A good NY/NJ diner should have the option of either home fries or hash browns and a good waitperson in a diner should also have asked you what kind of toast, either of which questions might have clued you in that you were having a communication issue.   I lived for about 15 years in NJ and have a lot of experience with diners in that region.  I have traveled a lot for work and I have family in various parts of the US and I now live in CA and I haven't come across \"bacon roll\" as a common term.   In my experience, there is no such thing as a standardized \"bacon roll\" or \"sausage roll\" in the US, or in NY/NJ diners. There IS such as thing as \"pork roll\" in NJ diners, but it doesn't have anything to do with bread rolls or omelettes -- it's essentially another name for the pork product more often called Canadian bacon elsewhere in the US, and you wouldn't find it in a NY diner unless they are catering to NJ folks (which doesn't happen).  It's possible that this particular diner calls omelettes \"rolls\" but that is not standard in American cuisine or in NY diners in my experience. In California, there is something essentially like a breakfast burrito that is called a \"roller\", but I've never encountered those in NY/NJ, and it would have had a tortilla.   If I were to imagine what it would be, I'd think of a (bread) roll made or served with bacon in it, and I think that is what most Americans would probably come up with. \"Bacon roll\" does not conjure up images of eggs or omelettes for me.  Next time, what you want to order is \"bacon on a roll\" or possibly a BLT (bacon-lettuce-tomato sandwich, usually served cold tho, on toast, with mayo). Most of the places you order that might be surprised not to have egg included in the sandwich. You could even say, \"like a breakfast sandwich without any egg\" or \"like a BLT without the lettuce and tomato\" to clarify.

So it's certainly traditional. But in your example the tomatoes bring some sweetness along with the umami, while the Worcester sauce (like soy sauce) is salty and so rich in umami it's used in small quantities. The effect of combining them is a more savoury sauce than one that tried to get all its umami from tomatoes. Red pesto uses parmesan to similar effect.  ",

At 158 degrees: They become totally firm, but are still bright orange and shiny. At 170 degrees: They become pale yellow and start to turn crumbly. 170 degrees-plus: They dry out and turn chalky. The sulfur in the whites rapidly reacts with the iron in the yolks, creating ferrous sulfide, and tinging the yolks.   ...  So long as your water never come above 180 degrees—at sea level, that's the quivering stage just below a simmer—you have no chance of overcooking  Also the comments are quite interesting. Just search for \"green\". Not sure if this works,  but one commenter suggests a method for avoiding the green coloration:  I watched Chef Pepin's cookshow once he taught the audience an important trick: to poke a tiny hole at the broad end of the egg (using a push pin or similar) before boiling. With this you can effectively eliminate the sulfuric smell and taste of the egg yolk, and simultaneously remove the greyish green \"rim\" around the yolk (which you can see between the egg white and the egg yolk from the pictures above). This method has work perfectly for me! And these small details are what make a perfect egg!  ",

I added strawberry puree ( which I added some lemon juice to) to my custard and it split the custard while baking. I'm guessing the lemon was the culprit but can strawberries split cream/custard too? If I wanted a strong strawberry flavor through my creme brulee how could I go about achieving that? ",
        "output_1": "Try an approach that often is used when making posset! First, cook cream and sugar (similar measurements as in a creme brulee), then pour a spoonful or two of the cream-sugar mixture into the strawberry pure and stir thoroughly. This should neutralize a fair share of the acidity that causes splitting. Then pour the strawberry puree in the cream, and stir thoroughly.  You could possibly whip the egg yolks separately with some sugar to help you obtain the desired texture, then slowly incorporate the cream into the yolks and then go on as usual with the creme brulee.  I am not promising anything, but this might work? ",
        "output_2": "This is a tough question. Fresh fruit puree is very unsuitable for incorporating in custards if you want a strong flavor. It contains tons of water, and dilutes your creme brulee a lot, and also brings the pH balance out of whack, interfering with the setting. You can only incorporate small amounts for color and a hint of flavor. Don't forget to add sugar to the puree when you are doing this, it strengthens the fruit flavor perception and reduces the negative effects on texture.   If you want a strong flavor, here are your options when having access to normal kitchen equipment, in order of closeness to the ideal of getting real strawberry flavor into otherwise typically-textured creme brulee:    Purchase strawberry aroma and use it. Don't forget to color the creme brulee, either with food coloring or with small amounts of puree.  Use freeze dried strawberry powder. You might have difficulty finding the real thing (pure strawberry juice freeze-dried) as opposed to maltodextrin-based powders, read the description carefully. An alternative is to grind strawberries which you have dehydrated yourself, but that will give you inferior results.  Cook down your own strawberry simple syrup and use that. This works with any fruit. Start with pressing juice of an amount roughly equal to your dairy base - if your recipe uses 350 ml of cream and 150 ml of milk, you need 500 ml of strawberry juice. Depending on your juicer, this will need 1.5 - 2 kg of strawberries. Make the juice, then add sugar at 1:3 ratio (so 165 g sugar for 500 g of juice). Cook on a low flame until a candy thermometer shows 104 Celsius. Let it cool to room temperature before using in the creme brulee. Quick alternative with somewhat worse taste: use a store bought jam, preferably a smooth spread without chunks.  Use liqueur. This is usually done with other fruits where there are traditional brands of liqueur, such as cassis, grand marnier or frangelico. But if you can find a good strawberry liqueur, try that. Alcohol is a great flavor carrier and will give you aromas you can't get from cooked down or dehydrated fruit. For best results, combine the alcohol with one of the other solutions here.  Instead of putting the flavor agent within the custard, go the traditional route and pour a fruit sauce over it. You can use the reduction from the previous point for that, or make it in some other way.  Again, instead of flavoring the custard itself, pour it over whole strawberries in the mold. This works better with poured custards or puddings rather than creme brulee, since the strawberries won't take kindly to baking.  Instead of making creme brulee, make a strawberry sabayon, using fruit puree or fruit juice as the liquid to be thickened by the yolks. This dessert has a strong fruity flavor, but a very different texture, and it also brings out the egginess of the egg yolks.    As an aside, these methods are useful beyond creme brulee, you have the same options for all creamy desserts (including panna cotas, starch puddings, cheese based cremes) and many types of cake icing, especially buttercreams.

At this point I've experimented with longer/shorter times for everything and am at wit's end. The bread tastes fine and has some good bubbles in it. It's just very flat. ",
        "output_1": "Oven spring is caused by the air pockets in the dough expanding from the heat. (Dough rises from gasses released from the yeast.)  After the shaping and final rise, often times there is a light, dry \"skin\" over the dough. By slashing a dough before it goes into the oven, you break this skin, and the bread is able to expand. If the loaf is a \"fancy loaf\" and you can't slash it without ruining the appearance (like a braided loaf), try to keep the loaf from drying out with a light mist of cooking spray after shaping and before the final rise.  Perhaps the bread is cooking too quickly when it hits the heat of the oven, essentially cooking a crust before the air pockets get heated enough to expand? Baking in a moist environment should help with that. Place an empty, sturdy pan (I use a cast iron skillet) on the bottom rack of the oven (or directly on the floor of the oven) before preheating. When you place the bread in the oven, pour about 1 cup of very hot water into the empty pan. This will create a bunch of steam, and help prevent the bread from crusting before it gets its \"spring.\"  If you have a pizza/baking stone, use it. Having a hot surface to set your pans on helps with the rise. Think about it... you open the oven door, and out goes a lot of the heat... even though the walls of the oven are retaining the heat, it will take a little while before that heat reaches the bread. Setting the pan on the stone will give you that instant heat on the bottom, causing dough to rise from the bottom up, rather than just getting a small rise from the top area.  If you don't have a stone, invert a heavy baking sheet, cast iron griddle, or something similar, and heat that up in the oven the same as you would for a baking stone. Invert the sheet pan so it's easier to slide your bread pans on and off the hot pan without having to deal with a small edge.  If you haven't got equipment to do the other options listed above, you can try the \"cold oven method.\" Just put the loaf into a cold oven, and set the temperature. Don't preheat. The gradual heat from the bottom of the oven as it preheats will give you some of that \"oven spring.\"  I use a baking stone and steam, but I have had great success with using an inverted aluminum sheet pan with steam before I got the stone... and before I learned that trick, I used the simple cold oven method (no steam as the oven is cold!).

They are called Klöße in northern Germany and Knödel in the south, both words mean the same.  -Rohe Klöße (Raw Dumplings). These are made from raw grated potatoes. They are the most difficult to make. The surface is shiny and a bit slimy and you have pieces of potatoes sticking out, which gives them a rough surface texture, see image below. The inside is chewy and you can just barely feel the individual slices of potatoes. They are soft, when you cut them they flatten and the surface is gluey and sticks to the knife. The basic recipe is to grate raw potatoes (1 kg) into a bowl filled with water. Then pour the mixture through a cheesecloth and press the cheesecloth in your hands till the mixture is very dry. Let the drained off water stand for a few minutes, the starch will collect at the bottom. Mix starch and potato mixture.   Boil some semolina (grieß), maybe 10% of the potato weight, in milk till it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot. Mix semolina with potatoes and one egg and form dumplings.  Some people use sulfur to give the dumplings a whiter color What’s the sulfur in dumplings for?  -Gekochte Knödel (Cooked Dumplings). These are made from boiled potatoes that are mashed while hot. Add about 10% starch and one egg yolk per 500g. These are simple to make.  -Halb und Halb, Thüringer Klöße (Half and Half). Mixture of grated and mashed potatoes. Do as for the raw knödel with half of the potatoes. The rest is boiled and mashed while still hot, I have something that looks like a huge garlic press for this   Mix the mashed potatoes and the dried grated potatoes and the starch. These dumplings don't use eggs or semolina, but you might want to add some extra starch if the dough is too sticky.  -Quark or Topfenknödel (Dumplings with fresh cheese (Quark))  Made from mashed potatoes with fresh white cheese. Tastes wonderful when filled with plums or apricots or with strawberry or rhubarb sauce. Unfortunately Quark is extremely expensive in the U.S.   The picture you showed looks like Rohe Knödel or Thüringers.  *Many people buy a mixture that comes in perforated bags that you throw into boiling water.   These are ok, but the ones you make yourself are more fun.  *In Germany potatoes come in three color coded varieties, firm, mostly firm and starchy. For all kinds use mehligkochende Kartoffeln (starchy). These often have irregular shapes and break apart when you boil them. It won't work with firm potatoes.   *Often Knödel are filled with roasted pieces of bread.  *You always have to prepare a Probekloß (Test Dumpling) first to check the composition and maybe add some flour.  *In general the dough has to be sticky, use wet hands  *Some use egg yolks and some entire eggs.  *I am to lazy to get the starch out of the water, I use regular bought starch.  Make sure that you are using the right potatoes (starchy). To me it sounds you are using too much flour and the wrong potatoes. Better use starch instead of flour. ",

The term \"brown flour\" is ambiguous, but I know it can sometimes refer to a ~85% extraction flour (see here and here, for example).  85% extraction means that 15% of the \"whole grain\" elements are removed (like bran and germ), compared to normal \"white flour\" which is typically around 70-75% extraction.  Such \"brown flour\" is sometimes referred to as \"whole wheat\" too, but it's generally lighter in color.

Aside from a rustic texture, it's more practical, as finely grinding the bran and germ requires more effort, and it's counterproductive as it causes the flour to become stale faster.  (The bran and germ will spoil faster than the endosperm/white flour portion, and increasing surface area through fine grinding will increase the rate of staling.)

He replies that \"fats, under high heat, produce their own separate browning reaction.\"  Maillard is not a reaction of fats, but the browning of fats works in tandem with  the Maillard reaction to produce flavors and aromas.  Oil does promote caramelization of vegetables in a roasting situation, which is what it appears you are missing. It doesn't take much for the desired effect. ",

Then I dry rubbed it with spices and put in my small crock pot with 150 ml of Guinness, a couple of carrots and baby potatoes on LOW for some hours. I stuck a probe thermometer in the meat and set an alarm at 65 °C (having in mind the target temperature of 72 °C and thinking of carryover cooking). It must be said that the meat was not submerged in liquid as the vegetables were on the bottom. But I didn't hear the alarm and the temperature went beyond 72 °C. After about 8 hours, the meat was shortly broiled and, after some rest, sliced. Tough as a rock. Now I'm not very sure I know how the graph tenderness vs temperature goes for this kind of meat.

If you'd taken it out when the alarm sounded it would be even tougher. You can't roast things in a crock-pot, you have to have food mostly submerged in liquid for it to heat. There's no real target temperature for brisket in a crock pot in the sense of 'when it hits this temperature it's done' because you need to get it to at least 72°C and keep it there for hours so the collagen breaks down. If you use a temperature probe 72°C is when the cooking clock starts.

If you do want to go that way, yes, you'd definitely want to practice on something cheaper, because it's likely you will mess it up. This is why a lot of people just take their expensive knives to a professional to get sharpened. I've seen good knives sharpened into oblivion before - totally reshaped blades, and still not even really sharp.  Most electric sharpeners are designed to avoid all this - the good ones have a fixed angle sharpening surface, and something to hold the knife in the right orientation, so you can't mess it up. The one caveat is that Western style knives have 20° edges, while Japanese style ones have 15° edges, so for example in the US, the sharpeners you buy won't be good for Japanese style knives.  Additionally, you don't actually need to sharpen them very often at all. Periodically honing your knife will keep it pretty darn sharp, especially if it's a decent knife and you take good care of it otherwise. Give that a try, and you may not feel you need to sharpen it for a long while. At that point, since you won't be sharpening it all that many times in your life, it may not be worth learning to sharpen the hard way - a professional or an electric sharpener will be a lot easier.  But if you do want to get a stone and teach yourself, the thing to do is probably to start with a finer-grained one, so you can't destroy the knife as easily. You can practice getting the angle exactly right, doing finer sharpening. Hopefully that's all you'll need, but if you ever need to do more, once you've got some practice, you can move on to a coarser stone for really reshaping the blade.

I recommend getting a thrift shop knife to practice on.  I picked up a combination coarse/fine sharpening stone at my local hardware store.  I think it's 400/1000 grit.  The coarse side shapes the blade.  The fine side smoothes out the scratches from the coarse side.  Honing does the final sharpening.

The butter was softened and I used everyday plain flour. I substituted half of the sugar with soft dark brown sugar, so about 5oz brown sugar and 5oz caster sugar. Instead of using chocolate chips, I used about 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract and about a dessert spoon of ground cinnamon for the flavour.

Therefore, the only effect of the baking soda is to increase the pH of the dough, which will encourage browning.  However, as the cookies are full of sugar, encouraging browning is not generally a problem.    The creaming method creates bubbles in the solid phase butter, and encourages rising and a more cake-like result, especially when paired with an effective leavening agent.  Resting the dough also hydrates the flour, and allows the butter to re-solidify, both of which inhibit spread and contribute to a higher cookie.  For a chewier result, do not use the creaming method.  Melt the butter instead, and then combine your ingredients.   You may also choose to reduce the baking soda to reduce the metallic taste it brings without anything to react with.    If the cookies are now too dense, you might try adding (starting with smaller amounts) 1/2 tsp  to 1 tsp or so of baking powder which has its own acid to react with, to help leaven the cookies.

        "output_2": "From what you have shared @ShadySpiritomb, I think the root cause could be the use of frozen rather than fresh mango. Most fruit has a very high water content, and freezing will cause the cell wall to rupture. When defrosted, the fruit will have a mushy consistency, and the flavour may be diluted by any additional moisture captured during the freezing process. The first thing I would do is defrost your mango in a sieve over a bowl in a refrigerator. That way, you can reheat the flesh separately in the sauce until you reach the correct consistency that you want for your curry. Before doing that, though, I would prepare a basic curry sauce by frying off onions, garlic, and whatever spices etc. you intend to use. Once these have been cooked off, I would add the reserved mango juice and reduce this by 30-60%, continually tasting until you are happy with the balance. By reducing the liquid, you will concentrate the mango flavour. Once this sauce is ready, add the mango and heat through. Depending on the condition of the defrosted mango, this may not need a long time; if the fruit is really \"mushy\", heating through will probably be sufficent. If it needs longer to soften, add earlier in the process. If desired, any tomato or coconut milk etc. should be added after the mango juices have reduced and before you add the mango flesh. ",

Puff pastry is mainly made by 3 important ingredients, flour, water, and fat (butter or oil). Unfortunately, I learned that butter and oil, consist of 100% fat. I've successfully created puff pastry using oil in a pan before. It works! I create 2 doughs, one dough is formed using flour and water, the other one is using flour and oil. Then, I do the pastry folding. So as no-fat alternative I tried using a flour-water dough and a flour-applesauce dough, laminated as for regular puff pastry. The result was crisp at the outside, but uncooked on the inside. I baked twice as long, and the result were very thick hard crackers. I can see the layers with different color, but there is no air in between the layers. I've also tried only using flour-water dough pastry, folded. Again I can see different colors of the layera, but no air in between. I haven't tried making the second dough with egg yolks though. It may interesting to see the result, since egg yolks supposedly have around 63% of fat. Research After that failed experiment, I read some articles about the science behind the pastry. It says that the pocket of air is formed because of the boiled water that becomes gas, trapped between the fat layers. I assume, it happens because the oil and water are not soluble. On the other hand, the boiling point of water is 100 C (212 F), yet the boiling point of oil is around 300 C (572 F). I see here that vodka has a boiling point around 78.3 C, which is lower than water. I  haven't tried vodka for the mixture with flour because vodka actually is also soluble in water. My question is: Is there any food grade liquid that has boiling point over 100 C and is not soluble in water? ",

Beeswax is not as malleable as butter though, so I'm not sure whether it can be used like butter to produce the layers in puff pastry dough. (Try perhaps melting it and use a food brush to apply a thin layer, as if applying egg yolk). Of course the texture of beeswax is more, well, waxy than butter. You certainly don't want too much of it in your cake. Whether the result is at all palatable is up to experimentation! I'd be glad to hear about your results in a later edit. ",

The brined pork chops had a   sodium content of 245 milligrams per 100 grams of meat (just under 1/8   teaspoon per serving); the enhanced pork had a bit more, with 268   milligrams. The kosher chicken breast weighed in at 252 milligrams of   sodium. The brined chicken came in with the most sodium of all, at 353   milligrams (just over 1/8 teaspoon per serving). The USDA recommends   limiting your daily sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams, about 1   teaspoon. Why did the chicken absorb more salt during brining than the   pork?

Somebody left out the lady fingers. You mix the first ingredients to make moccha, then pour it over the lady fingers.   For the cream, there are two possibilities. One is to use all ingredients. Beat the yolks with the sugar to ribbons, add the mascarpone, then slowly add the just-melted chocolate. Fold in the eggwhites beaten to soft peaks. Put over the ladyfingers, and when hardened in the fridge, sift cocoa powder over it.   While this is more likely, I don't see cocoa powder in the ingredients either. Also, so much cocoa might be so strong as to dominate the subtle taste of white chocolate. So you could make the same cream, leaving out the melted chocolate. Then, when the tiramisu has set, cover with grated white chocolate. This is also easier to make, if you are not experienced making creams and working with melted chocolate.   Update I made the recipe yesterday, now it has set after a night in the fridge. I put 90 g of the cream in an ice cream cup, and poured 30 g of the coffee mixture on it. Then I layered the rest as a normal mascarpone, using storebought lady fingers.   The version in the bowl could have used improvement. Some of the liquid found a way to flow to the bottom of the cup. The rest of it stayed on top, where it made a not-so-appetizing surface, slightly seeping into the cream. It did harden in the end, but it is not something a master pattisier would have made. If you insist on using it this way, you should do something else. For example, you could make a ganache by using 200 g of chocolate and 75 g of coffee, instead of the other way round. You can throw in a bit of instant coffee if you want a stronger taste.   The tiramisu looks like a standard tiramisu.

In my experience that's the best way to get a nice, noticeable, though not strong, cinnamon flavor in your drink with no unpleasant textural experiences. Sticks look nice, but impart little to no flavor. They're there for the look and the scent. Those two aspects will be enough to convince some people they're tasting cinnamon as well. But one thing about adding a whole stick to the drink is that you must A) take it back out before drinking, B) hold it in place whole you drink, or C) have a stick smack or poke you in the face while you drink. I usually don't think and end up with option C personally. The first problem with ground cinnamon is that sometimes it turns slimy, clumps together, and refuses to mix in. But you still get a nice flavor. The other problem is that when the powder does hydrate and sink in the drink it becomes much coarser and noticeably grainy. I never measured to see how much ground cinnamon swelled up in the bottom of my drink, but unlike the fine sludge that will settle in the bottom of a cup of French Press Coffee, to me the cinnamon sludge was undrinkably coarse. Of coarse I could just be buying the wrong type of ground cinnamon, but I think a very coarse grind might actually be ideal for coffee and tea. ",
        "output_2": "You can definitely put a whole stick of cinnamon in with your coffee grounds or tea leaves. If your cinnamon stick is very tightly coiled, the hot water may not reach the inside of the coil. Split the stick lengthwise so the water can more easily reach the inside of the bark (that way you get flavor out of both sides of the cinnamon bark instead of just one side. You're correct that you won't get all the cinnamon flavor out of a cinnamon stick in a single use. However, it doesn't have to be wasteful - you can reuse the cinnnamon stick multiple times. After your coffee is brewed, pull the cinnamon stick pieces out of the grounds, tap off any remaining coffee grounds, and lay them out to dry. It helps if you do this while the grounds are still hot, so the residual heat in the cinnamon stick helps it to dry fully. Make sure the cinnamon stick doesn't end up sitting in water. You can put it on a dry towel, or prop it up on the edge of a clean mug, or put it in a mesh strainer. Re-use the cinnamon stick as often as you make coffee. When you notice it starting to lose flavor, break it into more pieces. Eventually, the parts will run out of cinnamon flavor and/or get too small to be worth the effort of saving, and you'll start a new stick. Note: this works because the cinnamon stick has only been exposed to coffee grounds (or tea leaves) and hot water. Don't save a cinnamon stick that you've used to stir a cup of coffee with milk or cream. You won't be able to get all the milk or cream off of the cinnamon stick, and it won't be food safe for your next use, and it might taste bad.

If you're not sure, you might be better off transferring them to some large freezer bags.  I should also mention that freezing will only slow down the enzymatic activity that degrades fruit (and fruit juice) over time, not stop it completely.  Most fruit juice has been boiled to inactivate the enzymes, but if yours hasn't, then you might notice (bad) changes in the colour and taste over time.  If you plan to consume it within a few weeks, or if the juice already has various preservatives, then don't worry about it, but if it's very fresh juice and this is for long-term storage, then you might want to briefly boil it before storing if you're not sure about its history.

So, if your multivitamin nectar is like some I've seen, then it contains partly orange juice and pineapple juice that would put it in this category.  Orange juice is concentrated before freezing. That's to preserve taste, although there's the auxiliary benefit that it's more compact. The history of developing this process goes back nearly 100 years and wasn't perfected until 1948. Before that, OJ was canned and probably tasted not great at all. (Though canning actually preserves vitamin C better.)  Additionally, for most foods, a slower freezing process is worse than a quick one. I doubt this effects nutritional value, but it could to some degree? The slower the freeze, the bigger the ice crystals get and the more they interfere with cellular structure. So, if you have to choose how to freeze something, choose the coldest place. Where I live, that's definitely in the freezer. I do this for steaks I'm storing for a month or so and want preserved as well as possible.

Foodal describes the shape of the Dalstrong Ravager as:  The Ravager’s 9-inch blade is engineered with a pointed tip, designed to assist with skin removal and to access tight, deep spots that a square tip can’t.

The asian knives depth would make them more \"cleaver\" than \"knife\" by western standards. But none of those knives have the handle placement of the knife in the image.

But unsurprisingly it becomes soggy. It also became bland (I didn’t add salt the second time). Is there a better way?  (For what it’s worth, this is for store-bought, dried pasta; I rarely have the time to make fresh pasta, and I wouldn’t want to ruin it by cooking it twice.)

This will allow you to precisely control your re-warming step, and also avoid a rolling boil, which might be contributing to the pasta breaking apart.  If you don't have a circulator, you could reproduce the effect with careful monitoring on the stove top.  This could be an advantage for homemade pasta.  Alternately, and perhaps more simply, the article states that the pasta was just re-heated.  If you are using store bought, dried pasta, why not cook to a minute under-done, cool in ice bath, then add to the pan with your condiment to reheat and finish cooking?

Let the pressure release naturally, which takes around 5 minutes. Decant the rice into a large bowl, preferably metal. Separate the rice gently with a fork while the grains are still steaming. Add 1 tbsp light soy sauce and stir through until all the grains are evenly coated. Repeat with 1 tbsp dark soy sauce and 1 tbsp of sesame oil. By this stage, the rice will have become separate and almost cool. Leave until totally cooled off and use as you would overnight rice.  I have tried this with an electric pressure cooker, and the results have been excellent. The rice grains are separate, and as it is very slightly undercooked, by the time it has been fried in the wok the consistency is perfect. The metal bowl helps in rapidly cooling the rice, but you could achieve the same result spreading the rice on a baking sheet. I don't know what the times would be for a regular stovetop pressure cooker, you may have to experiment with that as the pressure differs between those and electric models. You might need to reduce the pressure time by 30 seconds or more, you know when you have it right as the rice is cooked through but doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.

Some doughs are intended for these paper-thin pizzas, other for deep-dish, almost cakey pizzas. Swap these and your results might be very disappointing.   A few pointers, how to \"read\" the recipe1:   Deep dish doughs typically have a generous amount of fat (olive oil, lard, shortening, whatever) and sometimes cornmeal while thin crust (for purists) ist flour, water, salt and yeast only (or perhaps a tiny bit of oil). Dough thickness for deep dish is around 1/2 inch / 1-2 cm, thin crust is, somewhat obviously, about \"as thin as you can get it without tearing\". Deep dish is baked in a pizza pan, while thin crust prefers a pizza stone or steel or, in a pinch, a hot cookie sheet. A deep dish needs at least 15-20 minutes, likey 30 or more until done, while a thin crust ideally is done in a few minutes (seconds, in fact, but home ovens don't get hot enough). Therefore a deep dish pizza is baked at 425F / 220C (sometimes a tad hotter) while for a thin crust you fire up your oven as high as it will go and use a well-preheated pizza stone to supply consistent heat.   As you write      perfectly baked on the upper and lower sides but still doughy in the inside   I'll assume you are more on the thick-crust side. So a few suggestions:   bake a bit longer to ensure the middle is done as well. This might require lowering oven temperature a few degrees to avoid burning the top and bottom. Make sure your dough is mature - while the edges usually handle being off quite well, the middle remains soggy or dense. (This is true for bread and other baked goods as well.) As I don't know your method, experiment with longer and shorter resting times or do some research on how to recognize the different proofing stages.  Consider par-baking the crust and adding the filling after 10 minutes or so. As toppings are typically already \"cooked\", this is fine from a food-safety view.  Another option is to go for a \"slightly thinner deep dish pizza\". Check the hydration of your dough: If you use a high-hydration dough (=lots of liquid in the dough), a pizza pan with tiny holes to let some steam escape downwards might be an opion. Or use a tiny bit less water.   And as I said, this is a bit of (educated) guessing, based on experience but lacking information.    1 especially the recipes with the nondescript title \"Pizza\"...

So:  A thermos must be a true Thermos® - or at least, a very close kin, double walled vacuum style.  The \"keep your hot food hot for 8 hours\" type, not just a coffee tin that will keep your coffee sort of warmish while you hop on the bus to work. You lose a few degrees of heat when you pour the water into a cold thermos - so I tested pre-warmed vs. cold thermos. How much water is needed? I had a 500ml Thermos® and two 300ml Thermos®, so that seemed an apt comparison.  My experimental setup: 1 pre-warmed 500ml thermos, 1 pre-warmed 300ml thermos, 1 room temp 300ml thermos.  One kettle of boiling water with about 1.5L water.  Three \"American large\" eggs, pulled from the refrigerator just as I started the setup but well after I put the kettle on (so only out for a few minutes, no meaningful raise in temperature from the 4°C fridge). Method: I poured some extra boiling water from a separate kettle about 2 minutes before the main kettle came to a boil into the 500ml and one 300ml thermos.  Then right when the main kettle came to a boil, I poured those two out.  Then I put eggs in all three (the warm 500ml one was very hard to do that in, it was very warm!).  Then I poured 100°C water (temped from my electric kettle) into the three, filling each to the fill line (the metal band) and as quickly as I could topped them each with the screw on top. Then, I waited 15 minutes. I left them alone - no mixing, no touching, me sitting at my computer ignoring them until my timer went off.  After that time was up, I opened all three and immediately temped the water in them.  Then, I quickly removed the eggs, placed them in bowls, and cracked them with a spoon, then cut with a knife. My results:  The 500ml setup cooked an egg precisely how I like it - maybe even a tiny bit overdone if anything.  Whites fully cooked, yolk medium to medium well with a great yellow/orange color.  The water in the thermos after 15 minutes was 80°C, which is right where it should be.  I'd pull this out a bit earlier next time, maybe after 10 minutes.   The 300ml \"prewarmed\" cooked a pretty decent egg also.  It was less well done on the inside than the 500ml, but many people would like an egg boiled this way, and it's well within my \"good egg\" range.  Whites firmly done, yolk not dry at all and a great yellow.  The water in the thermos was 73°C, so a bit below the \"done whites\" temperature by this point, but likely it was within acceptable cooking range (80°C-85°C) for the 10 minutes needed.   The 300ml \"room temp\" was inconclusive.  The egg was decent, but the color much lighter yellow - but also a much smaller yolk entirely, oddly small and pale compared to what I'm used to.  It wasn't clear if it was underdone or okay; it wasn't runny, certainly.  I don't know if the color was due to cooking or not.  The water was 72°C, so basically the same as the other one - maybe the prewarming made a trivial difference, or maybe it made no difference at all; I don't necessarily think it's likely to, but who knows.    I also separately tried an egg in 1L of water not in a double walled thermos.  This totally failed - the egg was still basically liquified; clearly partially cooked, but not something I'd want to eat, runnier than scotched eggs by a good bit.  The water had dropped to about 60°C by 15 minutes later, so it clearly was not in the optimal cooking temperature. In conclusion: yes, it's possible to cook an egg in 500ml of water in a thermos, provided you have a proper thermos that's capable of keeping the water at a high temperature!  It likely is possible to boil an egg harder than I prefer, but the more water you use, the better for that. My thermoses (the 500ml, and one 300ml, egg for scale):  ",

The same goes for fruit and vegetables (from often weeks or even months, e. g. pumpkins, down to days). If your definition of \"cooking\" doesn't require a heating step, food preparation can cause cross-contamination when germs from the outside/surface are transferred to the formerly safe inside. Example: cutting fruit that wasn't washed well enough. A third case of \"less safe\" would be \"cooking\" with insufficient heat: there is a fine line between \"kills pathogens over time\" and \"creates a cozy environment where pathogens thrive and multiply happily\". Note that this is discussed in detail in our generic posts on the topic. A border case in a \"food safety\" discussion would be creating byproducts that might have negative long-term effects like acrylamide or residue from char grilling. But that's pretty much a grey area with a lot of uncertainties in the equation. (And we don't discuss health here on the site partly because of that.)   In short, if cooking for you includes \"bacteria-killing heat\" and eating reasonably quickly after cooking and ignoring byproducts then no, cooking does not make food less safe.

The sugar content, alcohol and acidity have effectively preserved the fruit and killed the small amount of botulism and ecoli present, making it safe to consume (note that fermentation has it's risks too, but that's not the point here).  Jar 3, \"cooked\" / canned: This jar gets capped and placed in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes.

This is one example of a baker's couche. ",
        "output_2": "Jay's answer of a couche is great for relatively long loaves like baguettes or even ciabatta.  For oval or round loaves, however, you'll need support on more than two sides.  In that case, the solution is a basket known as a banneton or brotform (depending on which language you prefer to make your bread in).  Again, they are not for baking -- you dust them with flour and then gently flip them to get the dough out right before baking.  (Note that this is how bakers often make those lovely patterns of rings of flour on the top of their loaves.)  If you don't use either, you may still be able to achieve greater height by shaping more fully.  Many people have been cautioned by various books to shape very gently and avoid degassing.  I spent years producing flabby flat loaves this way, thinking that the key to loaf height was avoiding degassing and letting the bubbles grow.  But it's often the opposite: by leaving the bubbles too big and shaping gently, you don't stretch the gluten enough to provide support and the yeast actually grow more slowly since they are immersed in their own waste product gases.  (The only time to shape gently is if the yeast isn't strong enough to raise the dough again, which can sometimes happen with long sourdough fermentations or with very rich doughs like brioche, for example.)  While it's good advice to avoid unnecessary degassing (you don't actually want to \"punch down\" the dough to shape it), the main way to achieve a tall loaf is by having a very taut \"skin,\" and that generally can only happen if you shape forcefully to stretch that \"skin\" multiple times.  When I make free-form loaves without a banneton or other support, I generally:    Cut the dough into pieces after bulk fermentation. \"Preshape\" the loaves roughly into rounds or ovals by folding repeatedly to tighten the \"skin.\"  (Stop when the skin feels taut, and definitely stop if it tears.) Bench rest for 10-15 minutes.  (This allows the gluten to relax, before being stretched one last time.) Shape very tightly, again being sure to pull the skin quite taut.   For more shaping advice, I'd recommend looking at Jeffrey Hamelman's Bread: A Baker's Book of Techniques and Recipes, which devotes a 30-page chapter to shaping techniques, with a lot of drawings to illustrate the individual steps for each particular loaf shape.  (He also has another entire chapter on braiding techniques.)  Also, to increase the \"strength\" (elasticity) of the gluten in the dough, you could also try incorporating \"stretch-and-fold\" manipulations periodically during your bulk rise.  This will prepare the gluten even more before shaping.  Lastly, using a baking stone or steel can help in inflating the dough fast enough in the oven before it has a chance to spread even more: you want the bubbles in the dough to blow up like a balloon quickly during baking.  If they bake too slowly, the bubbles can collapse or the gluten will stretch out and allow the dough to slacken before the crust hardens. ",

I have had just as much success with starters I have simply mixed and put in a sealed jar as with the ones I have walked around the kitchen, vigorously stirring with my hands and so on.  You can maximise your chances of having plenty of yeast in your flour by buying organic, as there will have been no chemical treatments which might destroy the yeasts, but any decent flour should have more than enough yeast naturally present to make a starter with.  Yeast, however, is just one aspect of sourdough - you are also looking to cultivate various Lactobacillus species which produce lactic and acetic acid, which is what makes sourdough sour. These are everywhere and so there is no problem with finding them.   However, there are also 'bad' bacteria species that can make your starter go bad. To minimise the chances of this bad bacteria multiplying, it's a good idea to lower the pH of your starter, and for this reason I have had much more success with starters that use pineapple juice. Follow the recipe in this blog, replacing the water on days 1 and 2 with normal, unsweetened pineapple juice, and you'll be on your way. ",

I'm talking about the surface of some leaves and berries, they tend to have a little sap and be slightly acidic so the yeast that lands has good conditions to start growing and outstriping the other organisms that you don't want such as bacteria or mould. You can usually even see the colony because the fruit has a white dusting that is not natural. Sloes, Plums and Damsons are good examples. Autumn is a good time because the air is cool and damp, which helps the yeast grow.

        "input": "I'm starting with a recipe from Peter Reinhart's Whole Grain Breads that uses an overnight autolyse of a soaker (whole wheat flour, your choice of other grains, salt, and water) and a refrigerated  biga (whole wheat flour, a small bit of commercial yeast, and water). The recipe is for a hearth bread. I grind my own hard white wheat on the finest grind my KitchenAid mixer attachment can manage.  I'm looking to increase the fiber and protein content. The options I'm looking at in the \"other grain\" category include    psyllium husk: I am having a great deal of difficulty finding any instructions on baking with psyllium husk outside of gluten free baking, which I am obviously not doing. I am most concerned with how the psyllium might impact the water content of the recipe and how much is too much, given how small a standard serving is. I don't even know if using psyllium husk is a good idea given that no one seems to have tried it before. chia seeds: like psyllium, there aren't a lot of resources on using chia in wheat breads. I found one website that said it worked in commercial applications as up to 5% of the bread without changing much. In my recipe that works out to about 1 oz. Does that make sense? wheat bran: I have so far found one recipe that used a cup of wheat bran to 2 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup of whole grain mix. It seems like I can safely use a good portion of wheat bran, but I'm unsure of exactly how much vital wheat gluten: I have always seen a suggestion to use about 1 1/2 tsp. of wheat gluten per 1 c. of wheat flour for increased wheat dough elasticity. How high can I push the wheat content before it gets to be too much? My recipe allows for the \"other grains\" to be up to 33% of the baker's percentage. Could I use the whole thing on bran or would that taste like sandpaper? flax seed meal: I've seen people online adding 1/4 to 1/3 c. of flax to bread recipes. Does that sound about right?   Am I missing any high fiber or high protein seeds or grains that I should consider (like a bean, perhaps?). ",

On a scale from 0-100, foods like potatoes with a value of 70 or greater have a high glycemic index, while foods like peas and garlic, with a value of 55 or less, have a low glycemic index. There’s also a “very low” glycemic index categories for foods with a rating of less that 20, which includes lots of green vegetables, mushrooms, meat, and sesame and flax seeds. I’m sure everyone reacts a little differently to these foods, but the ratings serve as a tool to help people guess what they should try to eat more of or less of.  Sourdough  According to Wardee Harmon, non sourdough white bread has a glycemic index of 71, in the “high” category, while sourdough bread has a glycemic index of 53, which puts it in the “low” category. That’s because the bacteria and yeast consume the starches and sugars in the flour, so there’s less starch for us to process. The longer the fermentation, the lower the glycemic index. And when I make sourdough bread, I also use quite a bit of whole wheat flour, nuts, and seeds, which fall in the “low” category, even without being processed with sourdough starter.  ",

The difference from sauerkraut here is that getting into cucumbers is a bit harder, and cucumbers don't contain nearly as much nutrients as cabbage. Bread provides lots of starting sugar (and much other tasty stuff) for the bacteria/yeast to survive before they get into the cucumbers and adapt to feeding on something new.  Putting the jar into direct sunlight can get the temperature to 30-35 degrees, which is ideal for growing lactobacteria.  Specifically to your two questions:   Alcohol easily oxygenates into acetic acid (vinegar). This is further supported by presence of various other bacteria (esp. acetobacters). Bread is an ideal catcher of bacteria&yeast from the air, so even if baking kills everything, a 2-3days old loaf will do.

I wanted to say sushi rice, but I believe it's prepared a bit differently—or rather, it contains a different set of ingredients (depending).   Anyway, I have a regular medium-sized pot that comes with a very flimsy metallic lid. There's almost no weight to it. Out of curiosity, I tried out a method/tutorial I found online. This person used a similar pot, but the lid was glass. I initially boiled the rice, later covering it up to let it steam, and had to stop after about 2-3 min due to the bubbles forming from the pot. I prepared everything to a T and didn't really get to eat it as I couldn't even cook it.  So, from my understanding, there's like a minimum wait time when boiling, and then you pretty much just leave the lid on for a certain amount of time for it to cook.  While I could just as easily purchase a rice-cooker, I'd like to master this method first.  Am I doing something wrong or is there typically a specific pot you'd need to use in order to do this?  Thanks in advance!  EDIT: Link to resource. It's not the exact one I viewed before, but the setup is the same and the process as well as the tools used is very similar.

Normally, as soon as the pot is at/near boiling, turn the heat down to a low setting and leave it in the pot until it's ready. Then take it off the heat, but leave it covered (don't peek) for another five minutes. Generally, once you've added the water, you put the lid on. You only start the timer when it's boiled and you turn it down, though. That's probably why a glass lid is better, so you can see the boiling. It's not critical to the process, though. ",

As was mentioned in other answers, what you're going to lose most is the sear.  I was given a Corningware Microwave Browning Dish a while back and found that it actually works pretty well when you're stuck with only a microwave.  They were apparently popular when microwaves were new and exciting, but people didn't know how to use them well and they faded into oblivion.  I've seen them on sale on eBay so you might be able to find a good price there if you're going to be stuck in the hostel for a while.  The basic idea is, there's a special kind of microwave-safe metal inside the base of the casserole.  You heat this with nothing on it for 3 minutes to get it nice and hot.  When you drop the patty on, it immediately sizzles.  You use the microwave function to heat the inside, while the hot surface sears the outside.  Although you're likely not going to get a perfect burger, you do get a real nice Maillard reaction on the outside of both sides (assuming you flip halfway) and if you play with the cooking time and power (to reduce that rubbery texture from overcooking), you can get something that's (in my opinion) a good 75%-quality burger compared to a griddle or grill.  I actually burned pork chops on it once, that's how hot the surface gets.  As a bonus, similar to a nice Boos block, there is a gutter around the outside and the plate is slightly concave, so the juices run off into the reservoir and the burger won't sit in fat during the cooking.  After reading the other answers (ElendilTheTall's specifically), I would think if you combined the steaming method to cook the burgers, with the microwave browning dish to sear, you could probably get a really good result.  If the burgers were fully cooked via steaming you could probably heat the dish and sear the burgers without even turning the microwave on (except to heat the casserole initially).  I believe Alton Brown did an episode where he talked about a specific type of brick that you can find at most hardware stores which is microwave-safe for the same searing purpose, but I can't find that info right now.

Traditional Neapolitan pizza has official regulations requiring a minimum cooking surface temperature of 430°C, with an oven temperature at a minimum of 485°C.  (Note the Fahrenheit conversion temps are swapped in the document from what they should be.)  They are also required to have a bake time less than 90 seconds.  It's doubtful that one could achieve that in a traditional home oven or even most dedicated pizza ovens for home use.  There are lots of minor changes that happen with such fast cooking, such as the slight charring patterns on the bottom of the crust and on the edges, more significant oven spring, more rapid drying of the dough which alters the texture, etc.  However, by varying the dough composition (type of flour, other added ingredients besides yeast, salt, and water, such as oil/fat or sugar), one can create other styles of pizza that have some characteristics baked at lower temperatures.  Some people, for example, like to put a little sugar and oil into their crusts to change texture and flavor -- baking those pizzas at 500°C would likely produce excessive browning and charring.  A final thing to note is that temperature is often not as important as heat transfer rate in achieving pizza results.  Many people recommend making pizza on a preheated stone to increase the heat transfer rate.  However, in a home oven with a maximum temperature of 250-285°C or so, there's only so much you can do to raise the temperature of your cooking surface.    On the other hand, you can increase the rate of heat transfer into your pizza by doing things like (1) using a large thick hunk of steel to bake your pizza on (which can transfer heat much more quickly than a stone) and (2) turning on the broiler after the oven has hit its maximum temperature, which will increase radiant heat transferred into the top of the pizza (beyond that conveyed from the air in the oven).  The combination of maximized heat transfer on the top and the bottom of a pizza can bake the pizza a lot more quickly and achieve results that would normally require a much hotter oven.  It won't quite get you to Neapolitan-style pizza in a home oven, but it can get significantly closer.    (I can bake a pizza in roughly 3 to 4 minutes in my home oven using these techniques, a lot longer than 90 seconds, but significantly less than the 8-10 minutes or longer most people take with standard stones.  But the major noticeable differences aren't the cook time -- but rather significantly increased oven spring, better texture, and better browning.) ",
        "output_2": "The best pizza is cooked hot and fast. It's what gives you nice browned cheese and crispy crust without turning the whole thing into either some gooey undercooked mess, or overcooked throughout into cardboard.  You want the heat to reach the center of the pizza layers just enough while toasting the outer layers top and bottom.  A preheated pizza stone helps transfer heat to the crust, which is nice but if it's not hot enough it impedes the toasting. ",

If I had to substitute anise for fennel, I'd probably use a third or even a quarter of the original quantity. Although you might just want to leave it out. I agree with bikeboy - the great joy of fennel in Italian food is biting on fennel seed and getting that green-spicy hit in a meat dish (oh!

They can have both uniform, almost cake-y cross-sections, or air pockets and bubbles depending on how kneaded they are (more kneading means cake-ier, denser dough).  I worked in a shop that made a mid-dough similar to what you describe. It was a standard dough recipe (flour, water, yeast), but I have had success replicating it at home at 450'F with beer and less kneading. At home I use a pan and then finish either on the rack or a stone. In any case, you get a dough that tears nicely and has a good chew.  The dough itself was mixed in the morning and kept refrigerated for as long as 12 hours as individual shells in greased pizza pans covered with saran wrap. To prepare a pizza, we pulled the shell, punched it with a fork (puncture a ring around the edge to create a crust, puncture the inside to allow for air). Dress with sauce and toppings.  We had a stone-bottomed oven, but initially the pizza is baked in the oven in the pan until the bottom of the dough has hardened enough to get \"bricked\" (the dough should be rigid enough as to be removed from the pan with one spatula). At this point you remove the dough from the pan with a spatula and place it directly on the brick. Cook until the top of the dough browns, and the cheese and other toppings are evenly browned. ",

But even if there were, I don't think they'd necessarily be meaningful in comparing a particular store-bought culture to a particular \"heirloom\" culture.  The general thing to remember about store-bought cultures is that they are bred for rapid and consistent fermentation (generally in very clean and precise conditions), and they are propagated on a regular basis.  (That is, they generally aren't expected to survive intact for many days or weeks in a fridge before growing again.)  They also tend to have a few very specific bacterial strains added in specific amounts, and that mixture is kept constant.  (Usually, companies add bacterial cultures directly for each new batch, rather than inoculating with a \"starter\" from an old one; this ensures consistency.)  \"Heirloom\" cultures may have a greater variety of microorganisms, some of which may be adapted to surviving longer times between batches or fermenting in less precise conditions.  I'd say that when store-bought cultures \"fail\" or become \"less potent\" after a few batches at home, it could be due to a few different factors:   Culture was stored too long between batches, and some components died off Storage conditions between batches were problematic (e.g., less optimal temperature, bad pH) Less precise culturing conditions caused the \"equilibrium\" between various microorganisms in the culture to be messed up, perhaps leading to overgrowth or undergrowth of some elements, making the resulting product less consistent Other microorganisms were introduced (usually inadvertently through contamination), which compete with or otherwise imbalance the growth of the original culturing ones; sometimes storage can also affect relatively relative populations here too   There's no guarantee that a product advertised as an \"heirloom\" culture will necessarily do better for your particular yogurt-making regimen.  I have certainly heard of people having mixed results ordering online yogurt cultures.  But if it is a culture that has gone through many cycles of less-precise (\"home\") propagation, it may last longer and be more adaptable to various changes in yogurt-making regimen than the specific mixtures found in commercial store-bought yogurt.  Such \"heirloom\" cultures have been literally \"bred\" for a different purpose. ",

Just like whole-bean coffee, loose leaf tea keep fresh longer than bagged tea, and generally has a richer flavor.  Tea bags are generally prepared by the cut-tear-curl (CTC) process, which breaks up the leaves more than orthodox tea rolling, meaning they steep faster and more consistently.  As a rule, bagged teas are generally made from lower-grade leaves, and CTC processing helps hide defects.  They may even be made from fannings; these are basically the dust and broken pieces that settle to the bottom of a pile of tea leaves. Both of these mean that bagged teas can be prepared more quickly, but the flavor suffers.  The tea leaves are prepared by measuring them out into a ball or basket, which is immersed in hot water to steep.  Once the tea is steeped, the basket is removed to prevent the tea from developing a bitter, over-steeped flavor.   There are also a variety of other ways to prepare loose teas.  Despite the generally better flavor, loose leaf tea is not as popular as bagged tea in some parts of the world, because you have to measure out the tea and use a utensil to prepare it. Tea bags represent a greater convenience, which explains their success.    Below are three examples of loose leaf tea. The differences in color and shape of the leaves are the result of different processes used in preparing the teas after harvest.  Loose Sencha (a Japanese green tea)    Loose Keemun (a classic Chinese black tea)    Silver Needle (one of the finest Chinese white teas)      Powdered Tea  Powdered tea is also available, although it is not as well known as bagged or loose tea.

It is generally prepared by whisking leaves and hot water together in a bowl  until foamy, using a traditional bamboo whisk known as a chasen (pictured).  The result is a powerfully flavored, heavier drink with a higher level of caffeine and antioxidants.     Powdered black teas are also popular with Indians, and are used in preparing masala chai.  Spices are boiled in milk, and then powdered black tea is prepared in water separately.  There are a lot of variations on this procedure, but it seems to be the most popular approach for Indian customers.

From there, you can use any recipe for pork sausage that appeals to you, just increase spice a bit to compensate for the strength of bear meat flavor. You don't need to stuff sausage casings or anything like that unless you care to. Smoking or any other specialty technique is also entirely optional.

In a bread, the starch granules are the same way: right after baking, they contain too much moisture.   Sure, if you eat the bread right away, the aroma is very good. But the texture is problematic.

I am writing you to kindly ask for a clarification, though.      I am trying to realize if marinading and post-processing in the oven   are both necessary step or if by using the oven I may skip the   marinating step.  I would love to be able to make safe jerky without   seasoning because of the added salt.

Thank you VERY much for your kind assistance.   Here's the reply.     Marinating is not required; it is used only to add flavor to the meat.      What you have suggested, without marination, would be fine to do.   That is based on research, not on opinions.

How long can I keep it like that and how can I tell if it's gone bad? It has separated so that there are little bits of ginger in the bottom, but when I shake it, it looks fine. Also, is a mason jar better than the plastic bottle? ",
        "output_1": "How long this will last depends largely on the ratio of sugar to water in the final syrup.  Sugar can inhibit the growth of microbes by reducing the water activity of the solution, but this is dependent on the amount of sugar.  According to a book that I consider quite reliable on these matters, a syrup composed of equal parts sugar and water (by mass, not volume!) will generally keep unspoiled for about 2 weeks.  A syrup with 2 parts sugar to 1 part water will keep as long as 3 months.  These both assume that you're keeping the syrup refrigerated in an airtight container, which it sounds like you are.  Unfortunately, unless you know the exact ratio, it's tough to predict exactly how long this will last.  Discard immediately if you notice any of the following:   Any visible mold (hopefully this one's obvious) A cloudier appearance (harder to judge since you have some suspended particles; you might try running it through a fine-mesh strainer) Any gas bubbles or outgassing when you open the container (this is a sign of fermentation)   You might also consider adding a small amount of alcohol.  This provides another hurdle to microbial growth, and would extend your syrup's shelf life to somewhere between 3-6 months.  I generally add about 1/2 oz of 80-proof (40% ABV) vodka per 8 oz or so of syrup.  Regarding a mason jar, the main advantage these have is that they won't trap flavors the way that plastic can when re-used.  A strongly-flavored substance stored in plastic for a time can contribute some of its flavor to the next.  Since you're storing a strongly-flavored ginger syrup in a former soda water bottle (which is nearly tasteless) this probably isn't a concern, but if you used the bottle again whatever you put in it might come out tasting subtly of ginger.  Glass doesn't have this problem. ",

For complete safety, it's important that the actual canning processing be pressure cooking.  The problem is, even if the jar is sterilized, and the food is safe before you put it in, there's no way to completely ensure that no additional spores make their way into the jar before you close it. I don't think there's really any good way to assess the actual level of risk, but it's a \"why take the chance\" thing - in the unlikely event the food does get contaminated, there'll be no sign, and the botulinum has been given an ideal environment to grow in.  Note also that in order to actually sterilize the jars, killing any botulinum spores, you'd have to pressure cook them too, so you already need a canning pot big enough to hold them even for this plan. (It sounds like maybe you were thinking of using just a boiling water bath, but then they're only safe for use for high-acid foods that you can in a boiling water bath, not for low-acid foods that you need pressure canning for.) ",

This is also the reason why it is not longer advised to bother sanitizing jars before filling them with food if the processing time will be at least 10 minutes or longer.  Additionally, the vacuum seal created in a pressure canner is FAR stronger than the weak vacuum seal created in waterbath canning. For reference: I can fairly easily pry a waterbath canned lid off of a jar, but there is NO WAY I am able to pry a pressure canned lid off of a jar.

Aside from the usual safety precautions for dealing with a material that sublimates at -109.3F, I am concerned about what effects it might have on kitchen equipment.  On my first attempt I used a hammer to break up the dry ice in the bag, but it took an excessive amount of time to powderize it sufficiently.  It occurred to me that it would have been much quicker to break the dry ice into manageable pieces and then put them in the (electric) blender to finish the job.   However, I am unsure what effect this will have and don't want to have to replace an expensive piece of equipment because the cold ruined the blades, cracked the glass of the container, or caused other issues. Will powderizing dry ice in an electric blender damage it, cause excessive wear, or noticeably reduce its service life?  Since dry ice sublimates, should I remove the rubber seal so it isn't damaged? Would I be better off getting a cheap \"disposable\" blender for this purpose or it is fine to use the one I have? Update: Per the question in the comments, the specific model is Oster Pro 1200. ",
        "output_1": "I haven't tried dry ice in kitchen equipment, but have destroyed a plastic measuring jug with liquid nitrogen (the scale had become illegible so I took it into work where it would be handy, then abused it).  The failure mode could be expected to be relevant to plastic and glass used with dry ice. Many plastics become brittle at low temperatures - this can even be seen when using some plastic food storage boxes in a domestic freezer.  Cooling also causes thermal contraction, and most of this will happen by the time you get down to dry ice temperatures.  Because of the low thermal conductivity of plastics (and glass) the inside shrinks but the outside doesn't because it doesn't cool much.  In the case of my jug, the strengthening/supporting ring on the bottom stayed at room temperature when the rest cooled, and the bottom dropped clean out of it.  While dry ice is far warmer than LN, it's still cold enough for embrittlement and a lot of thermal contraction. That's not to say it will fail, only that it might.  Dry ice doesn't make such good contact with the container as LN, but localised cracking could still be an issue with plastic parts. A glass jug would likely fail completely even with localised thermal cracking. Borosilicate (some Pyrex, either old or European - I don;t know if it's used in blenders but it's possible for ones that are mean to take heat) or metal should be fine (careful handling the metal). I'd research the cost of a replacement part, but probably risk it, taking a few  steps to reduce the risk:  precool if possible, in a freezer (for even contraction; this will also reduce the amount of dry ice you lose) add the other ingredients first if possible (though you sound like your recipe breaks it up before mixing it in).  When making LN ice cream, drizzling it into the ingredients while stirring is the usual method (this is me holding the bowl while one person stirs and another pours). add the dry ice through a feeder cap if your blender has one (mine does) with it running  An experiment Many blenders use polycarbonate jugs.  This is a tough plastic that can handle hot liquids, so is a good choice if you're putting soup in there. I had an offcut of polycarbonate (Lexan) at home, and while I don't have access to dry ice, I can get liquid nitrogen, which gets even colder.  The first thing I tried was cooling a piece of aluminium to -100°C (a little cooler than dry ice) and resting it on the polycarbonate for a few minutes.  There was no cracking .  Even immersing the polycarbonate in liquid nitrogen for several minutes didn't make it brittle.  So a polycarbonate jug (not all plastic blender jugs are polycarbonate, but many are) should be absolutely fine with dry ice. Applicability to glass The specific model in question here uses a glass jug. I can't find anything definitive on the type of glass. If it's borosilicate (as suggested by some branding, according to a review, but I'd be very wary of sharing that assumption) I'd expect it to be fine.  If it's normal soda-lime glass, there's a small risk it could fail suddenly. ",

This type of shrimp paste has a very unique taste that sets Indonesian cuisine apart from all other Asian traditions I have tasted.   Bami Goreng in the Indonesian kitchen is made from thick flat noodles made from wheat flour such as the ones shown here.  As far as I know the Singapore variety is always made with thinner rice noodles. A very important distinction as the two types of noodles have very different flavor and texture.  Where the taste/spicing of the two is concerned, the Indonesian version is mostly savory from the use of the Terasi, sambal and ketjap. What is typically served as the Singapore version is seasoned with Curry Powder and should therefore have a more spicy/sharp character.  In all honesty, all these distinctions rely on the correct naming of the separate dishes in the UK. They should be quite different, but in practice the same dish might be sold under both names. ",

        "output_1": "10 minutes on high should be just fine for a medium to large potato.  I suppose it's possible it could burn if it's a very small potato, or if the potato is severely dehydrated.  I would expect it to produce a lot of smelly smoke before it actually catches on fire, so you'll likely notice that it's gone wrong before you need a fire extinguisher. ",
        "output_2": "I felt this needed a physics answer.  tl;dr: It's unlikely but not impossible - we have to make some unrealistic assumptions to make it work for a sensible size of potato  Consider a homogeneous spherical potato in a vacuum*:  According to Wikipedia potatoes are 79% water, 17% carbohydrate (mostly starch), 2% protein and 2% fibre.  Figures I've seen elsewhere vary by a few percent, so we can simplify to 80% water and 20% starch (the thermal properties of protein-and fibre-rich foods are close to those of pure starch so we can treat them as the same).  Water has a specific heat capacity of 4.3 kJ/kg/°C, and starch 1.75 kJ/kg/°C. That means that our model potato has a specific heat capacity of 3.7 kJ/kg/°C (a real measured value is a little lower at 3.43 kJ/kg/°C, but as we will see, water dominates the results).  First we consider the heat energy required to get the potato up to the boiling point of water (100°C), assuming a starting temperature of 20°C (room temperature), and a potato weighing 0.2 kg (just under half a pound, so a small jacket potato).  0.2×80×3.7 = 59.2 kJ.  1  kJ is 1 kW for 1 s, so a 1 kW microwave, 100% efficient,  would heat this potato to boiling point in about 1 minute.  This is considerably quicker than realistic for several reasons, and this is something we're familiar with:    The microwaves don't penetrate to the centre so much of the potato is heated only by conduction. While this is going on the hot surface is losing heat to its surroundings by convection, conduction, and radiation. Microwave ovens aren't 100% efficient at delivering their stated power into food, though it's surprisingly hard to get figures on losses.   Once the temperature of the potato is 100°C, it won't keep on rising; instead the heat will go into evaporating the water in it.  The latent heat of vapourisation of water is 2300 kJ/kg or 460 kJ for our potato.  This is near enough another 8 minutes (total 9 so far) at 1 kW, before we can start to get above 100°C by boiling off all the water (I assume the potato is isothermal, which of course isn't true, but thew timescales are long enough for significant heat flow).  Once we've boiled off all the water we can start heating the remaining dried potato (starch).  We only have 20% of the mass left (i.e. 0.04 kg of starch, the specific heat capacity of which is 1.75 kJ/kg/°C).  Red heat is at least around 700°C (for steel, but the potato would char to carbon at lower temperatures and carbon should be close enough to steel).  The extra 600°C rise would take another 600×0.04×1.75 = 42 kJ of energy, or 42 seconds.  So it's just about possible to get a 200 g potato red hot in a microwave in 10 minutes, but only if we:   neglect all heat losses (except those due to driving off water), which would be significant. I won't go into detail but the potato would have a surface area of 154 cm2 and would radiate only 12 W net at 100°C but 168 W at 400°C (just below the autoignition temperature, and a significant fraction of the input power). The plate/turntable takes away some heat by conduction, and we can;t really neglect convection (but it's hard, hence the assumption of a vacuum).   assume 100% microwave efficiency.   On the other hand we assume no energy is released by combustion, and if we can get the dry starch to its autoignition temperature of 410°C (Wikipedia) it will burn, releasing quite a lot of heat (the heat of combustion of starch is 17.5 mJ/kg, but much of this is lost to the potato).  Another point that makes burning more likely is that we don't actually need to get to zero water in the whole potato before some of it can start burning.  This would mean that more of the heat of burning some potato is useful in heating the rest, and would be of particular interest if the turntable of the microwave was jammed or there was a hotspot that received considerably more power than the rest.  A similar effect would be caused by conductive (e.g. metal) particles on the potato, as they'd cause a small region to get very hot.  These don't really fit with the even burning shown in the photo.  Those who are interested in the physics may wish to look at The Thermal Properties of Potato, T. Yamada 1970.  It's in Japanese with an English abstract but the figures give clear results for the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity.  A 1-dimensional thermal model would be an interesting undergrad physics problem.    * not strictly required but for once a sensible simplification - and we physicists so rarely get the chance to follow this stereotype.

It's my understanding that when an egg's yolk is still soft (or not cooked at all in this case), it hasn't been cooked long enough and can contain salmonella.  Is there any way I can still use eggs in my recipe but somehow ensure that I don't need to worry about salmonella?  I've tried looking for pasteurized eggs, but couldn't find them at any of my local supermarkets. ",
        "output_1": "First of all, it is extremely rare for the yolk of an egg to become contaminated if the egg is reasonably fresh.  Contamination only tends to occur when the egg is quite old and the yolk membrane weakens. (Source)  Now, that said, egg yolks begin to set at a temperature of 62° C (144° F), and salmonella can be killed at temperatures as low as 59° C (138° F), so it actually is possible to \"cook\" the yolk sufficiently to kill any bacteria without letting it set, but you have a very small window to work with, so you need to be careful.  If the temperature is even 1° too low, you'll just be encouraging the spread of more bacteria, and if it's even 1° too high, you'll ruin your recipe because the yolk will set.  Nevertheless, if you have a reliable, uniform heat source, you could attempt to heat the egg to 60-61° C for about 1 minute.  Unfortunately, you won't be able to use the technique used in other recipes - such as Bavarian cream - of simply using the residual heat of the other wet ingredients to cook the yolk sufficiently for safety while not allowing sufficient time to set.  Dark chocolate is the most heat-resistant but will easily burn at temperatures significantly above 50° C (125° F).  Mixing the chocolate with cream may raise this temperature slightly, and I admit to not being certain of the exact amount, but I'm pretty sure it won't get you up to the required 59° C - and it really actually needs to be much higher than that because the temperature must stay that high for several seconds after adding the eggs.  So my advice to you is to either:   Pre-cook the yolks very carefully to a temperature just below 62° C (use a thermometer!); or Use very fresh eggs from a reliable source; or Don't eat mousse made with egg yolks, if you can't tolerate the (very low) risk.

I have tried using the pasteurized egg whites that come in cartons.  They don't whip as well, so I added a bit of unflavored gelatin to help build some volume and stability.  The texture is a bit different; it ends up like the commercial chocolate mousse you will get at most restaurants.  If, for example, you follow David Lebovitz's recipe, you could use the 3 tablespoons of liquids any way you want.  Some of it could be coffee or used to dissolve 1/4 pack of gelatin that you then add to the last stages of whipping the pasteurized whites.  On the in-shell pasteurized eggs.

        "output_1": "Natto shouldn't be salty by itself, because salt kills the culture that grows on the soybeans. Salted soybeans are fermented into miso; unsalted ones become natto.  Normally, you'd season the natto with some combination of strong Japanese-style mustard, soy sauce, scallions or Japanese leeks, and maybe grated nagaimo if you want an even more mucilaginous texture.  The flavor of natto is fairly mild; the aroma is certainly stronger than the flavor itself, and is reminiscent of bleu cheese and sweat. I'd say it's slightly sweeter than a boiled white soybean would be, but it's possible than an objective measure of sugars might disagree with me there.  Soybeans are very mildly bitter on their own. Tempeh, a similar cultured soybean, tends to be slightly bitter, but I would say it's not a very pronounced trait, if at all present, with natto, as most of the bitterness seems to be removed by the fermentation.  Assuming you started with frozen natto that wasn't freezer burned that you allowed to reach room temperature, or fresh natto that wasn't excessively old, I would simply mix the natto aggressively in a small bowl for a few minutes until the mucilaginous strands form. Then season as desired.  If you're expecting a surprising flavor, by the way, you may be disappointed in nattō. Japanese cuisine emphasizes contrasting textures much more than aggressive flavors, which is to some extent why so many dishes are seasoned only with varying proportions of salt, soy sauce, sugar, sake and mirin, and vinegar (su).  But if you're experiencing an unusually bitter natto, that sounds like a problem with the natto that you purchased, rather than the ingredient itself. ",

Since it's a byproduct of producing butter, I would suppose that early peoples developed recipes to use buttermilk solely, instead of remixing it with butter like in most recipes I see online -- though this is just a comment rather than a question, feel free to share any insights.  Backstory is I tried whipping my own butter to use in my cookie recipe. The results were absoutely superior (soft, fragrant cookies), since the butter still has some buttermilk left inside. I was able to produce the same yield whilst holding back one egg from the usual recipe. ",
        "output_1": "Historically, milk was accumulated in the churn until there was enough to be worth making butter. The milk would, of course, ferment. Both the butter and the watery buttermilk took the sour, fermented flavor.  Modern buttermilk is different. It is low fat milk that has been cultured and fermented. It is thicker and creamier but has a similar soured flavor. (I've been told. I've never tasted historically fermented buttermilk.)  Therefore, historical recipes are not going to be the same as modern recipes that call for buttermilk.  The \"buttermilk\" left in your homemade butter would not have fermented and would not be similar to historical or modern buttermilk. It does have a good amount of sugar and protein, and of course water, that would affect your recipe.  In modern recipes, buttermilk is used to lower the ph, add a tangy flavor and a creamier texture than milk. The added fat is not usually a factor. Creamy buttermilk can be made with skim milk.  As dlb pointed out in a comment, the creaminess and acid allows chemically risen baked goods to be fluffier with the same liquid and fat content as regular milk. ",
        "output_2": "The role of buttermilk in most recipes is to provide acid into the reaction with baking soda to cause it to 'rise' more. The thickness helps the batter retain the air pockets that the acid + baking soda creates when heat is applied, resulting in a 'lighter fluffier' outcome.

By \"parmesan sprinkle cheese\", I assume you are referring to the ones that come in a parmesan-wheel shaped box, such as this:    Their shelf life is far longer than their expiry date, and I would not be worried about using it beyond that date. However, for those boxes, most manufacturers tend to use the youngest cheese possible (for Parmesan this means 12 months), meaning it has not had as much time to age (some parmesan is aged for as long as 36 months, and some manufacturers age it for even longer than that), meaning that there isn't much flavor in it.  Personally, I stopped using the boxes a few years back, when I realized that I used far more than I would if I simply used a grater and a piece of parmesan, meaning that it I spend less (if memory serves, I calculated the annual savings to something like 300 Norwegian Kroner/50 US Dollar) on parmesan, getting more, and I think better, flavor from it.  It should be noted that my family uses a LOT of parmesan (depending on how often we have guests, we go through anywhere from 1/4 kg to 1 kg per month), so the savings argument may not hold true for you.

Question: Would it be best to add the beans right before canning so they don't get over cooked or do you think there would be little difference if they were cooked with the chili before canning. I'm trying to avoid mushy beans but would like to cook a big pot and can the left overs. I usually add the beans in the last half hour of cooking anyway. ",
        "output_1": "As with all canning endeavors there are several guidelines that dictate how to can chili SAFELY. For starters, as this is a mixture of low acid foods, this MUST be pressure canned. Secondly, regarding the fact that it is chili - when canning chili that contains both meat and beans as you will be doing, you can ONLY safely do so in jars pint-sized or smaller. Additionally, you must thin it out to the point where a spoon stuck vertically into it will immediately fall over (this is due to potential density issues where the heat will not evenly penetrate to the center of the jar when using larger jars or very thick chili).  I misread the question and the following paragraph is regarding DRY beans, I'm leaving it here in case someone else comes along and it ends up being useful to them  Regarding the beans, standard canning directions for beans should apply here - that means they must be soaked overnight, then brought to a boil and held there for 2-3 minutes before being left to soak in the hot water for another hour. At this point they will not be soft enough to eat but they are considered \"fully hydrated\" for the purposes of canning. Regardless of this though they will still soak up more water during the canning process and while being in the jars so I would suggest to thin the chili even more to account for them soaking up some liquid.  If using canned beans then you can probably just mix them in right at the end before adding it to the jars. I think it does need to be a \"hot pack\" into the jars, so as long as the canned beans warm up to the temperature of the hot chili they should not need any further cooking prior to canning.  For best bets regarding safety with this, stick to this recipe and processing instructions (or at the very least, try to stick to the bean/meat/liquid ratio): http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_05/chili_con_carne.html  NCHFP is a trusted website to provide safe and tested canning instructions. There are a LOT of unsafe practices flaunted on youtube and pintrest so its important to always check things against a tested source.  It should also go without saying that the standard non-cannable list of things still applies, to safely can this you cannot add any form of thickeners: corn-starch, flour, etc. (this also includes things like rice and pasta although I don't know why that would be in a chili :) ), its also better to avoid adding as much fat as possible - butter/oil, and if you can drain the fat off the meat after it is cooked.  Dairy/eggs is also not safe to have in canned goods in any amount, this would include cheese and milk/cream. (Not sure if most people put this in their chili but I do so thought I would mention it)  Safe canning! :) ",
        "output_2": "If you are going to be canning this for long term storage you will need to be pressure canning it, and as that will mean some pretty high heat you'd be better off not cooking you beans too long before canning.

So my answer is equally broad: rice pairs well with fresh tastes and acidity, or with moderately sweet components. Or you can just underline its own slightly nutty notes. Below is a list of specific examples, but it is impossible to make it exhaustive.   For fresh tastes, use herbs. Summer savoury and spearmint are the classics, I never make stuffed peppers without them. But other light tasting herbs are also a good choice - lemon balm, oregano. Rosmarin is sometimes good, but somewhat overpowering, it is better for a dish where the rice is cooked together with veggies (eggplant, zucchini).   Beside herbs, you can try more exotic seasonings. Lemon zests are good, finelly chopped grape leaves and shoots are great.   Coriander powder should give you a similar taste profile to cilantro, but it is easier to keep at hand for when a quick dinner without much planning is needed.   The sweet option is also interesting; if you don't overdo it, it is OK to serve it as a side dish for a savoury meal. The easiest way to achieve it is to cook the rice together chopped dry fruit. Sulfured raisins are popular, the dish will be somewhat si milar to pilaf. But others work too, I especially like dried apricots because they are slightly tart.   Other methods for sweetening don't really fall into the \"dry seasoing\" category, but are  worth mentioning. You can add fruit juice to the cooking water (apple or other slightly sour juices are best; this will affect the starch in the rice, causing it to cook firmer than usual) or you can add a small amount of sweetener to the cooked rice (prefer aromatic sweeteners lik honey or C grade maple syrup). Or if you prefer it spicier, mix it with a sweet chutney, like mango.   If you want a subtler taste, combine the rice with nuts (cook them together). Always use nuts with the brown skin removed. I have found unroasted, finely chopped nuts to work better this way. Hazelnuts and almonds are a very good choice. Para nuts also pair well with rice, but are seldom availablr blanched+chopped.

First, start with homogenized milk (you don't want to risk undissolved fat swimming on top of it). If you want the pure milk flavor, heat it to 70°C and wait until you are left with half the initial volume. This takes several hours, depending on the quantity of the milk. My great-grandma usually did it overnight.   If you don't mind a \"scorched\" taste, you can do it much quicker. Take a very big pot. It should be at least 6-7 times higher than the milk depth, because the boiling milk will foam up a lot. The width is up to you, but the wider the pot, the quicker it will go. Bring the milk to a vigorous boil. Use a setting which is just hot enough to sustain boiling, too much heat will increase the scorching. Stir all the time. You need maybe 10 minutes of stirring, again depending on quantity of the milk and pot width. You are aiming for the same rate of evaporation - you should be left with half the original volume, or somewhat less.

Some use cacao interchangeably, since cocoa is from cacao; but as cacao has other uses and forms that would be like saying I am eating a Bhut Jolokia Belladonna.  Cacao, in raw, pod form is not going to present the same characteristics of cocoa powder (i.e. try a smoothie with cacao and one with cocoa, they're quite different). Yes it is still bitter and earthy, but there is a brightness and the eathiness is more \"green\" (sort of like grassy, less of the \"roasted\" flavor). That said, this gap may be bridged depending on processing. Getting the cacao into a pasta form, I am inclined to assume that the cacao will need to be ground to varying degree. As a paste it would still bear the marks of cacao. Per a thread on cheftalk, I am inclined to guess that if it is ground further and past a powder, possibly powdered with butter etc, it would be more akin to cocoa (bitter and unsweetened presumably, though this would change with process).   If it has the earthier components, but not quite chocolate-y, from processing, I would encourage you to pursue light sauce and things pairing with asparagus or that otherwise border on \"grassy\" when over cooked. Typically a good counterpoint for cacao smoothies is banana (I mean, bananas are a Swiss Army knife in smoothies, anyway) as opposed to berries. You might consider plaintains and aleppo in some form. Or to push in a different direction I am inclined to think milder shellfish would bear well. You can just google results for chocolate-y pasta if it is just basically chocolate pasta.   As a tangent: Some people ascribe health and nutrient benefits to so-called \"raw\" cacao, if this is up your alley you would likely want to avoid high heat cooking/preparation.

Fresh yeast has a specific taste and aroma, which disappears during fermentation, giving you a different, bready taste, which is not the same as yeast taste. Pro bakers are normally trying to achieve perfect fermentation, using low yeast amounts and long fermentation types. Household recipes are trying to take a more convenient route, preferring speedy fermentation (so baking times are reduced) and lots of yeast (because 1. this allows for even quicker rising, and 2. some decades ago, yeast quality was not so good, and you had a chance that the culture in a cake you purchased was barely alive, so it wouldn't rise if you used the minimal amount pro bakers with fresh daily supplies went for). This results in lots of unfermented yeast, which gives homemade breads a specific yeasty taste. While pro bakers will try to avoid it, many people associate the taste with pleasant experience of homemade bread made by a beloved family member, and like having it in their own bread.   So, use cake yeast. About the highest amount you can get away with would be 10% (50 g cake yeast per 500 g flour). But if your bread starts getting a whiff of ammonia, reduce it a bit. Ferment at warm temperatures (30°C is good, yeast starts slowing down over 35) and wait for volume doubling at each stage - should take 30-40 minutes per stage.

Why does ghee (and probably also other oils) burn when put into a hot pan? What is the remedy for this?

        "output_1": "Yes, your pan was too hot.  Because your pan was empty when you heated it, it had minimal heat capacity, and could only lose heat by convection and radiation.  Thus, it heated up quickly, and likely reached a much higher temperature than it normally could with food in it.  When you heat a pan with food in it, some of the heat is transferred to the food, and much of that heat is, in turn, lost when water in the food evaporates.  This slows down the heating rate, and significantly reduces the peak temperature reached.  (Evaporating water is an extremely efficient method of heat transfer, especially at high temperatures, and even solid foods like meat and vegetables still contain quite a bit of water.  Any time you put something on a hot pan and it steams or sizzles, that's the sign of water evaporating.)  Also, because you didn't have any oil or water or food on the pan, you had no easy way to gauge its temperature by eye.  Normally, if you heat a pan with oil already in it, you can tell when it's hot enough just by looking at how the oil behaves.  If you miss all the subtler signs, like the oil turning more runny and starting to form convection patterns, the point where it starts to change color and smoke is an unmistakable sign that you've definitely heated it too far.  With a dry pan, it's quite hard to tell just how hot it is.  One trick I sometimes use is to sprinkle a few drops of water onto the pan and seeing how quickly it evaporates.  (Don't do this if the pan already has oil in it!)  When the drops evaporate all but instantly (but still briefly wet the surface, rather than exploding on contact or hovering over it), it's time to add the oil / butter.  Of course, the modern high-tech alternative would be to get an IR thermometer.  I actually do have one, but I rarely use it — it's just quicker and easier to dip my fingers in some water and sprinkle it on the pan than to get the thermometer out of the cupboard. ",

Add acid to taste (balsamic or wine).   I like to serve it on a bed of barley, and pour the sauce over.

A storage option that allows you to keep your butter fresh for a pretty long period, but still leave it out on the counter so it's soft, is a butter bell. You can look them up online--many shops have them. It's basically an inverted cup that sits inside a larger one with a little water at the bottom. The butter is packed into the inverted cup and stays put when you place the cup so the edges are under the water in the other cup. The water keeps air out so the butter stays fresh even at room temperature. You could do the same thing by mashing a bunch of butter into a teacup, then setting it upside down in a saucer full of water. If it's too hot in your house, though, the butter will slip out of the inverted cup, so I mostly only use our butter bell in the winter.  One thing to note about butter itself: Some butters are more spreadable at cooler temperatures. The Irish and French butters we can get here are much closer to spreadable at refrigerator temperatures than the regular US supermarket brands. I'm not sure what the difference is, though. ",

If you do decide to remove the husks, the easiest approach is to squeeze each pod along its longest axis (so, trying to make it shorter). This will tear the sides of the pod and expose the seeds.

(Exactly the same applies to Indian bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon stick, etc: they can be eaten if ground up in a spice mixture that is to be distributed throughout a dish, but otherwise they are discarded as eating them whole is uncomfortable.) Cardamom powder is added to sweet dishes. I don't keep cardamom powder as it loses its flavour quickly, so I make it as needed with a pestle and mortar. For this I use only the seeds, and use the husks to add a little fragrance to tea. But I am not sure whether commercially available cardamom powders typically use the husks.

I'd possibly need to degas it first to get rid of the CO2, but I think it sounds kind of delicious...  Has anyone tried this before, or can anyone think of any reason not to?

Alton was probably saying that using water for braising and sauce making is bad, and he's right.  The best sauces are made with great stocks as their base and then through reduction and additions of other flavouring agents and garnishes turned into things of beauty.  A stock made with an ale sounds like a great experiment but it would be limited in it's uses.  Braising some pork with a sweet dark ale is a great flavour enhancing dish.

For your beer idea, for example, I would cook down a couple bottles and add some stock to it.  That way, the rest of my batch of stock would be useful for other recipes that don't use beer.  Note that stock may be boring but shouldn't be flavorless; stock still should taste good.  If your stock was flavorless, try upping the amount of meat, veggies, and herbs compared to bones.  Also, bear in mind that stock should not contain salt (you will likely reduce the stock at some point).  The lack of salt, however, will deaden the flavor.

From what I've read about oolong, \"nutty and fruity\" are not typical characteristics of IGoM, where as the floral, honey suckle-like flavor of Numi's is. So I'm thinking Twingings is mislabeling their tea since Iron Goddess of Mercy is a well known type of oolong. It wouldn't be the first time I've seen tea mislabeled so its not unthinkable. This chances the question, to \"what oolong is nutty and fruity\".  Recently I discovered that I love Twining's oolong tea.  It has a light, refreshing flavor. Unfortunately, in the US, it is only sold in units of 20 bags, so I purchased a 1 pound bag of Numi's Iron Goddess of Mercy.  The tea is certainly good, but I prefer the Twinings. Where Twinings is nutty and fruity, and it tastes like neither black nor green tea, Numi's tastes much like green tea with a floral falvor. Its still good, but I like the Twinings better.  I then looked up oolong and found that unlike green, black, and white tea, oolong has a wider range of variation. While its true you can have different types of green or black tea (Darjeeling, gunpowder green, sencha, macha...) those all have, at their base, the same ingredient: camellia sinensis leaves that have been dried and processed either with 100% oxidation (black), or 0% (green and white). The difference between green and white is then when the leaves are plucked.  In the case of oolong, the oxidation, and the means of oxidizing, varies greatly (from 8% to 80%), and from mild bruising to fermenting. Iron Goddess of Mercy is one such type of oolong.  My question is then, \"what type of oolong does Twinings sell\" because I would like to buy a big bag of the stuff (albeit from another company).  Another bit of information that might help: The tea, brewed, is darker than the Iron Goddess of Mercy tea (at least Numi's) which implies greater oxidation. ",

These are likely single supplier farms - so they will only sell to Twinings or a handful of companies. It is said that teas have a terroir similar and even more complex than those ascribed to wines, so it could well be that the taste is down to the farms they have as suppliers.  ",

Most marinades should be fine to freeze. However, if you're starting off with meat that was frozen, you may not want to refreeze it. There are a couple reasons for this:  1) If the meat was frozen and NOT kept refrigerated (i.e., defrosted on the countertop or in the microwave), there's a chance that bacteria could start to grow in the meat, and freezing it again won't kill the bacteria. This isn't a problem if your meat is refrigerated and kept in an airtight container. The USDA has a quick guide on freezing, defrosting and refreezing here.  2) Texture may be affected if you refreeze meat. Most meat dries out a little in the process of freezing and defrosting, so doing this multiple times will probably affect the texture. When the ice crystals form in the meat, they  burst cells, which then lose juice when the meat is defrosted. The result is often mushier, less juicy meat.  As a less scientific reason, the Food Network has recipes where they say you can freeze marinated chicken. Sometimes, if it's good enough for the Food Network, it's good enough for me... :) ",

This may be exacerbated by using low-protein flours, which do not generate as much gluten as high-protein flours (called strong flours in Europe).  This tends not to manifest as a collapse, so much, as a failure to rise. Considerable overkneading, to the point where the gluten network begins to break down, and cannot hold the gas (this is quite unlikely, unless machine kneaded) Over-proofing (allowing to rise or ferment too long), which creates more gas than the gluten cells can hold, leading to their rupture and collapse when the heat of the oven causes expansion and oven spring.  This leads to collapse of the loaf.   Without more information, it is difficult to tell which of these you are experiencing. ",

Confectioners sugar or cocoa can come handy for a quick dusting should you need to hide a few, ahem, cosmetic flaws.

You need to strain it through something finer.   Many (most?) tea bags are made of a sort of filter paper, some are made of very thin silk. You can place a clean square of silk in your tea strainer (large enough that it completely covers all the mesh with some to spare) and pour the tea through that, or you could also use a paper coffee filter if you have those available.   There is also something called a tea sock which is basically a tube of thin fine-mesh fabric (sometimes silk, sometimes nylon or polyester) closed at one end.

If you bake them, just clean, bake, then cut in half, and put through the ricer.  (Again, not really that much faster).  If you're cooking red potatoes, even if you're not using a ricer, there's no need to peel them beforehand, as you can boil them whole, then rub the skin off with a dry towel.  (of course, for red potatoes, they're always going to be lumpy, and have texture, so in that case, I tend to leave the skins on).  To reduce the overall time, if I'm going to be going for a smooth mash:   Only use large potatoes.  Save the smaller ones for applications where you don't need to peel potatoes.  Cut the potatoes into slabs.  There's no need to get them to cubes.  I tend to go to about 2cm (~3/4\") thick.  Any extra cooking time is made up for by reduced cutting / transfering bits to the pot / dealing with the chunk that fell and rolled under the cabinet / etc. Start the water warming while you're peeling.  You don't want to place the potatoes into boiling water, but you can take some of the chill off it. Toss a few cloves of garlic (whole, but paper removed, end trimmed off) in with the potatoes, so you don't have to season afterwards. Use stock rather than milk.  I keep boxed vegetable and chicken stocks at room temp, not chilled, so I don't have to heat it up first to deal with the issues of it cooling down the starches too fast. Decide if the ricer's really worth it -- I get good results just tossing everything back into the same pot after straining, hit 'em with a potato masher, add some liquid, then go through a few more times.

Apparently translucent rice is also a thing. The closest I've found are recipes like this one for transparent Chinese dumpling dough - but these aren't very transparent and are gooier than would be ideal alongside pastry.    If there's no such thing that has an established name or recipes, it would be great to have a few basic principles on how it might work: for example, how the pure starch that glass noddles are apparently made from could be sourced and adapted to be pastry-like without losing translucency?

If they were thin enough, you should be able to cut through them  to serve the pie (though they probably wouldn't cut neatly).   I agree with the previous answers on several other points though. You could use something akin to a Korean sweet potato noodle. They are exceptionally clear, but the gummy and chewy texture probably wouldn't do a pie any favors.

Arrowroot starch is frequently used in this role on fruit pies, I don't see a reason why it shouldn't work on savory pies.

Cooking time is all about heating up the food (and/or evaporating water), not putting energy into some chemical reaction.  Cooking is slow because it takes time to get the inside from fridge temp to your target, and food doesn't conduct heat very efficiently.  And for a rare roast like this, not about time-at-temperature either like BBQ where you're converting collagen to gelatin.  And stopping at 110F is too low for anything to happen anyway.    On the day of, before putting it in a real oven, warm it some (not cook) in a microwave on medium power (like power level 6 out of 10 on a 1500W oven for example) for several minutes to heat the meat somewhat uniformly.  (Sorry I don't have a solid estimate for this, and of course it depends on the absolute power of your microwave.)  Maybe 10 to 15 minutes, and maybe on even lower power than that.  You need time for heat to transfer from hot spots so they don't actually cook.  Check for hot spots after 10 mins, and maybe put it in for another few minutes if it's not very warm yet.  To avoid hot spots cooking on the surface of the meat, you'll want a microwave with a turntable.  Maybe even turn the meat during some microwave time.  Then stick a probe thermometer in and roast as normal, starting from a meat temperature of maybe 90F.  You just want to warm it, not even close to cook any of it with the microwave.  And let it rest some to even out hot spots that were close to starting to cook, before you put it in the oven.  Your goal with the microwave step is to get heat energy into the middle of the roast without starting to even brown the outside.  Microwave ovens can do this somewhat better than hot air because microwaves penetrate slightly into the meat, into the wet part, where heat can more efficiently conduct inward without drying out the outside.  You have to be careful not to actually cook parts of the meat, just get it up to around room temp.  A roast for a special occasion is probably not the best time to experiment with this, and be sure to read the comments on this answer.  I think they're being too pessimistic and are basing their opinion on actually cooking meat with a microwave, not just warming it up.  But maybe I'm wrong and there's no way to usefully do this.  I have done this with steaks before pan-searing with good results: less time in the pan is needed, and you still get a browned outside layer and a nice rare or medium-rare inside.  Ideally you can get the inside medium-rare with less of a well-done layer outside it.  (A significant part of the cooking of the inside still comes from traditional cooking; you're just starting with a warm piece of meat instead of fridge temp).  If you're a little aggressive with the microwave you'll get some cooked patches on the outside (especially with a steak; a roast is maybe more resistant to that.)  If you see that, stop the microwave and let it rest for a few minutes to come closer to thermal equilibrium before going into the regular oven.    A roast is done when the centre reaches a high enough temperature.  If it starts uniformly at fridge temp, cooking by roasting in a hot oven heats it up by heat transfer from air to the outside layer of meat.  This is slow, so it takes time even for the outside to heat up and start heating the inside by conduction.  This hot air also dries out that layer, letting it get significantly hotter than inner layers (and letting browning reactions happen forming a crust).  This is why you want to roast at a low temperature so this doesn't go too far before the cold centre of the meat gets up to temperature.  Starting with the meat hotter some/all the way through (closer to thermal equilibrium than you'd get from oven heating) means not as much heat energy has to be conducted all the way from the outside of the roast into the middle with dry heat, so you'll have less of a well-done layer.  When you put in the probe thermometer, you'll get some idea of how much temperature difference you have between the outside and inside.  If it's significant, perhaps let it rest a couple minutes.  Not more; the meat will be right in the danger zone for bacteria so you should get it heating again quickly.    This is not something I've tried with a roast, only steaks.  It's simple physics, though.  Other ways of heating meat without cooking the outside include sous-vide.  In that case heat transfer slows down as the meat temp approaches the water bath temp, so you can use it to get the meat all the way up to desired temp.  This is not the case with microwaves because they apply near constant power to a layer around the outside, and not evenly.  This is why you have to stop before any the meat is even close to fully cooked, and let the temperature even out.  (Do note that microwaves don't really penetrate very deeply, but they can get about a centimeter in so heat has a head start conducting into the centre of the food.) ",
        "output_2": "Two stage cooking is generally not a safe practice unless the food comes to at least 130-140F during the first stage, held there an adequate amount of time to kill off bacteria, then is chilled quickly, and then reheated relatively quickly.  Commercial food service has a lot of fairly complex rules dealing with these sort of \"pre-cooked\" and reheated situations, because they are one of the places where it's most likely to cause foodborne illness.    Since you likely wouldn't want to go to temperatures that high (and I don't blame you), I'd recommend cooking it all yourself at one time for safety reasons.  Also, aside from safety concerns, I agree with moscafj's comment: I'm not sure what the purpose would be here.  Is it to get some benefit from the \"rotisserie\"?  It's possible to get somewhat similar effects by roasting slowly (at low temperature) at home, even without a rotisserie.    EDIT: Since the OP has identified the goal as decreasing cooking time, I agree with AMtwo that this process won't help.  I'd only add to AMtwo's answer that it might actively hurt the quality of the final result, as both the butcher's rotisserie and OP's relatively high-heat oven temperature will likely cook the outer layers of the meat further, while leaving the interior very rare.  Doing this twice will actually compound this problem, so if the goal is a rare roast (as I'm guessing from the target temperatures mentioned), this will actually result in a thicker layer of more \"done\" meat near the edges with more time to dry out.  Better to just cook it once. ",

Traditionally Bao is made with yeast but if your recipe includes baking powder as the main leavener, then you would need to steam the Bao as your recipe indicates. Otherwise the leavening will expend itself and you will get tough Bao.  If the Bao recipe you are using have yeast as the main leavening agent, then you can do either.  If you want to steam it the next day then you can leave the dough in the refrigerator to rise the first time overnight. You might want to decrease the amount of yeast used in your recipe in this case. The next day, take the dough out 2 hours before you want to steam it and let the dough sit for about 1 hr to get to room temperature. Then cut and form the dough into the Bao shapes and let it rise for another 45 minutes at room temperature. Then you can steam it.   Resteaming Bao is not an issue if thats the route you want to go. A lot of places that sell Bao actually premakes it, steams it and then refrigerates the Bao. Then it is resteamed when it is needed. You can even freeze the Bao if you make a particularly large batch. The quality of the Bao won't degrade too much as long as you resteam the Bao.  ",

Secondly, it's fairly common for Boas to be reheated by re-steaming. The re-heat process will still retain the softness and slightly chewy texture of the Baos.   One advice I have is to make sure you cool down the Baos after the you first cook them before refrigeration. If you don't cool them down, the Baos will become too wet and the re-heat will make too soft.  ",

Sometimes the oil will separate a little and will need to be mixed back in. I would group frostings in this group although, of course, they contain far more sugar. See this recipe: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/gale-gand/chocolate-hazelnut-spread-with-crepes-recipe/index.html  Thick chocolate candy. AKA fudge. These contain water but the sugar and water are cooked together into a syrup so the water is not able to immediately dry out. They will crystallize if they are badly handled- many recipes contain a little corn syrup to prevent this. This does not seem to be what you are trying to make.  2- Store your concoction in a lidded container that isn't too much larger than your sauce. I use mason jars to store mine. Alternatively you can push plastic wrap down onto the surface of the spread.   3- Refrigeration. Recipes that don't contain dairy don't need to be refrigerated and in fact shouldn't be because it causes them to harden.  4- Adding water to melted chocolate is only a problem when dealing with chocolate that is dry and meant to solidify such as a molded chocolate. In such a case even a drop of water will cause seizing. In this case where there is already quite a bit of water in the recipe seizing is not a risk and you shouldn't have any problem mixing a tiny bit back in. Do not add water to the nutella-like spread recipes. They do not contain water and it will not mix in.  I can't tell from your description what is causing your sauce to harden- it could be drying out, separating, or crystallizing. Any of these will be solved by reheating and thoroughly stirring.

While most recipes for quickbreads in use today are indeed for banana bread and such, there are older recipes (especially from wartime) where normal, non-flavored bread is made with soda. Using them is probably the best you can do. Caveat: the more breadlike you want the texture to be, the more dense will you have to make the bread, because developing the texture takes time, and baking soda and baking powder lose their leavening properties with time.   I would advise you to stay away from sourdough breads. They don't contain commercial yeast, but during fermentation they catch wild yeasts. The wild yeasts are closely related to commercial yeast, and likely to trigger the same allergies as commercial yeast does.   The last variety, unleavened breads, are flatbreads. They are dense due to lack of leavening, so if they were made thick, the center would not bake. This means that you can't cut them into slices to make a traditional sandwich. But if you relax your definition of what a sandwich should be like, you can use unleavened breads like tortillas or matzo layered with the ingredients, or make actual wraps instead of sandwiches. Pay attention though, not every flatbread is unleavened, naan for example contains yeast. Knäckebröd is a flatbread which can be leavened or unleavened depending on brand, and it makes excellent sandwiches.   You can also try making sandwiches with non-bread substances. A jibarito is a sandwich where the filling is packed in fried plantain slices instead in bread. Other vegetable slices like zucchini or oven-dried eggplant should work too. Puffed rice wafers are also a good sandwich packaging, as well as savoury waffles (make your own or read the packaging, because there are yeast-leavened waffles).   Other types of leavening are not used in breads (such as meringue leavening which is used for cakes only), but if you like baking and want to make your son's diet more varied, you can try adapting cake recipes to savoury, breadlike results. Adapting recipes is more for advanced bakers though, because the sugar in cakes plays important roles besides giving them flavor.   It is important to note that most of my suggestions are pretty different from the everyday yeast breads most people use for sandwiches. You probably won't get anything too similar to them (quickbreads will be the closest). Don't try to imitate them as close as possible, you will be frustrated. Teach your son (and why not yourself?) to appreciate the substitutes which make for very tasty non-traditional sandwiches with their own charm.  ",

        "input": "I recently got a samovar tea kettle and am not sure about how to use it. For those of you confused about what I am talking about, this is my samovar (electric):    The metal part is a kettle for boiling water and keeping it warm. On top, there is an opening, on which you put your pot. You make very strong tea in the pot and keep it warm throughout the day by placing it on top of the samovar. When you want to drink a cup of tea you first pour in 1/10 to 1/3 tea from the pot and mix it with water from the samovar.  The point of the whole system is to have tea on demand all day for many people. By having only water in the metal part and strong concentrated tea in the pot every person can mix their own tea and make it as strong as they want to. In addition, you only need to clean the pot, the samovar is only used for water.  With this kind of kettle, you are supposed to brew the tea for a long time, and you need to choose a tea with low bitterness.   What I don't understand:  Isn't it a bad idea to have tea brew for so long? Am I even doing this right? Does the long-brewing provide any kind of benefit? Isn't it also a bad idea to continuously keep your tea warm throughout the day? I ended up removing the tea from the pot after several hours. It ended up so strong, that even when mixed 1:10 it was pretty much undrinkable for most people. But I guess I probably used too much tea, so this could have been avoided.  Also, would it be OK to put the tea in the samovar, or is the \"svarka\" (the tea concentrate) an integral part of the whole thing?  For reference, here is a samovar, without a pot on top:    Presumably, in this case, the tea is in the samovar and there is no concentrate? ",
        "output_1": "The problem with black tea is that after a few minutes of brewing, the leaves release very bitter substances. There are 2 general ways to deal with this:   Short brewing time: remove the tea leaves or bag after about 3 - 4 minutes. Saturation: if the tea water is saturated with non-bitter substances at 3 minutes of brewing time, it cannot take up much of the bitter stuff. Traditional turkish tea is brewed like that as well, so I suppose it should also work in a samovar.   The concentrated tea is an integral part of the system. You should not add any water to the svarka pot after initially brewing the tea or you give the bitter substances a chance to solve into the tea.   The tea brand is important, too. I'd propose to try an Earl Grey or another tea with a light taste. Ask a tea shop for advice, if you have one nearby.  The ratio of 1:10 sound about right. Most people have to get used to the idea that barely covering the bottom of the cup is enough.  Putting the diluted tea into the big kettle is a very bad idea and probably won't solve your problem. Every green and black tea will get more bitter over time, no matter how it was brewed. I think keeping the concentrate for a whole day is simply too long. 3 - 4 hours is the longest I would keep brewed black tea. You could make smaller portions to use up the concentrate in time.  Experiment with different brands and different amounts of tea, always keeping in mind that you're making a concentrate to keep the bitterness out of the tea. A splash of milk can neutralize a little of the bitterness, but the milk has to be very cold for it to work. If all else fails, brew peppermint tea instead ;) ",

        "input": "Many older cookbooks call for filling a “refrigerator tray”. For example, in the 1960 Better Homes and Gardens Dessert Cook Book the recipe for “Banana Ice Cream” says to “Pour into refrigerator trays. Freeze till firm.” and in Anne London’s 1972 American-International Encyclopedic Cookbook, the recipe for “Refrigerator Tray Pie” says to “Pack half the crumb mixture into a refrigerator tray. Chill… Return to refrigerator to freeze.” Doing a search for “refrigerator tray” on archive.org, I found the pamphlet for Use and Care of Your New Norge Refrigerator which mentions many uses for refrigerator trays, all involving freezing in some way. From the various recipes for ice cream and other frozen desserts on pages 31-32,  Pour into refrigerator trays and freeze.   Freeze in refrigerator tray.   …freeze in refrigerator tray until firm.  From this, I can deduce that a refrigerator tray is something that you can pour liquids into and then put into the freezer, but that’s about it. Those pages also mention trays without the qualifier “refrigerator”:  Pour into tray of chilling unit and freeze to mush.   Pour into tray and chill to soft jelly… Return to tray and freeze to desired firmness.   Turn into freezer tray and freeze 45 minutes to 1 hour.  The list of definitions on page 9 does not include a definition for refrigerator trays, although it does include one for ice trays, and specifically mentions using them for making ice cream:  Ice Trays: Fill the trays with water to within 1/4 in. of the top. Place trays in their section on top of main freezer compartment. When making Ice Cream, use the aluminium tray by removing plastic cups or dividers.  I would guess that the ice trays mentioned are the metal trays for making ice cubes, which used to come with a removable (always metal, in my limited experience) divider that doubled as a loosening device for the ice cubes. They seem awfully small for use as a dessert pan, but then the Better Homes and Garden recipe did use the plural for its mention of refrigerator trays. ",
        "output_1": "For freezing ice cream or other confections in a refrigerator’s freezer area, a refrigerator tray was a rectangular, shallow, open container. The ice cube tray (often provided with the refrigerator) began, around the mid-to-late thirties, to be fitted with a removable divider so that it doubled as the refrigerator tray. Ice cube trays with removable dividers are referred to as “refrigerator trays” and were designed specifically for freezing desserts. The terms “refrigerator tray”, “freezer tray”, and “ice cube tray” were used somewhat interchangeably for making desserts with these trays, at least during the period after ice cube trays with removable dividers were included with refrigerators and until the included ice cube trays became one-piece plastic trays. The Carnation Fun to Cook Book, for example, has a recipe for “tropical freeze” on page 40; for the final freeze, the recipe is poured into “two small (or 1 large) refrigerator trays”. The drawings accompanying the recipe show shallow, rectangular trays.  Experiences with Foods by L. Belle Pollard includes notes on “making ice cream in the home refrigerator” on page 258.  The ingredients have been combined according to the recipe and poured into the refrigerator trays or molds.  The accompanying photo shows two of these refrigerator trays. They are metal, rectangular, and shallow.  You can also see refrigerator trays used for desserts in this 1951 commercial for a Westinghouse refrigerator. By at least the late 1960s, authors had begun to use the term “ice cube tray” in recipes for ice creams made in the refrigerator. In Vincent and Mary Price’s 1965 A Treasury of Great Recipes, there is a recipe for Tre Scalini’s Hazelnut Ice Cream on page 93 that says to “Pour into 2 ice-cube trays and freeze. This makes a soft ice cream.” Borden’s The Dessert Lovers’ Hand Book from 1969 also contains recipes for making ice creams in the home refrigerator. The accompanying illustration shows the same shallow, rectangular container, but in this case calls it an “ice cube tray”—despite there being no cube shapes in that container as drawn. The ice cube grid has been removed.  Borden’s 1952 Borden’s Eagle Brand 70 Magic Recipes uses the term “freezer tray” for the same Vanilla Ice Cream recipe that their 1969 Dessert Lovers’ Hand Book contains. The recipe is the same; only the terminology has changed. One patent for a refrigerator tray with removable grids for ice cubes is Richard E. Kaufmann’s patent 2,112,027 filed October 3, 1936, found in the Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office Volume 488. The patent is labeled “Refrigerator Tray” and shows a “removable grid for ice cube trays”.  A slightly earlier patent, Louis Brownstein’s patent 2,037,364 from March 17, 1934, is labeled “Ice Cube Tray”, but specifically mentions its use for desserts:  My invention further contemplates the provision of a freezing tray from which the grid partitions and other parts may be readily removed for purposes of cleaning or when the tray is to be used without its partitions, as when it is desired to freeze desserts, etc. in the tray.  Brownstein writes specifically that the grid-less tray may “be used for freezing liquid desserts in one mass”. You can see ice cube trays with removable dividers in this 1954 commercial for a Crosley Super Shelvador. Here’s an example of a later iteration of an ice cube tray with a removable divider, a double-sized Quickube from a Frigidaire refrigerator:  Notes  While traveling recently I acquired Borden’s Dessert Lovers’ Hand Book and Price’s A Treasury of Great Recipes. The reference to ice cube trays in these two books provided the necessary clue to answering my own question—that a refrigerator tray and an ice cube tray were at least in some instances the same thing. This led to finding Kaufmann’s patent on a refrigerator tray that was clearly an ice cube tray. Borden’s 1969 Dessert Lovers’ Hand Book also includes instructions for making ice cream in specialized ice cream churns; the 1952 70 Magic Recipes only has recipes for making ice cream in the refrigerator. The archived version of Borden’s 70 Magic Recipes that I linked to is supposedly dated 1956; I’m not sure how archive.org arrived at that date; the only obvious differences between the archived version and my copy appears to be that (a) mine has a copyright year of 1952 on the inside front cover where the archived version does not include the year in the inside-front-cover copyright statement; and (b) the inside back page on mine has what I think is a print date of 8-52 and a version of E-56 where the archived version has what I think is a print date of 5-63 and a version of E-56 Rev. The Quickube ice cube tray has levers for more easily removing the grids from the tray, a feature mentioned in later patents such as F.W. Sampson’s 1946 patent 2,573,066 and E.H. Roberts’s 1956 patent 2,763,997 both of which are fascinating historically but don’t address this question.  ",

A cake that is increased in size but also baked in a wider pan so its overall thickness is about the same as the original may not need much additional cooking time at all, or the increase might be small.  When one increases all dimensions (and thus increases the thickness too), it takes longer for heat to migrate to the center and thus may need a more substantial increase in cook time.  Also, I want to address the reference made to \"increasing the oven temperature.\"  Generally speaking, when making a larger cake or quick bread, you don't want to increase the oven temperature, as it may very well cause excessive browning on the exterior (or burning, along with perhaps drying out near the edges) before the center is cooked.  If anything, larger cakes and quickbreads sometimes call for decreasing the oven temperature, to allow extra time for the interior to cook before the exterior gets too brown.  If the temperature is decreased, the time must be increased to take this into account.  (FuzzyChef's linked document shows these trends too.)  Unfortunately, there's no general rule that applies in all cases, as some quick breads may be prone more to excessive browning, while others may be fine if baked a bit longer at the standard temperature.  Sometimes adjustments in leavening or other ingredient adjustments may be necessary to take into account different time/temperature as well as to allow a structure that must rise higher. ",

How can I clean these vegetables? ",
        "output_1": "Let's call a spade a spade: if you're in one of many areas where people don't eat vegetables raw, it's because nightsoil or unsterilized animal manure is used to fertilize the fields. A quick rinse won't render these vegetables safe to eat, because you need to kill the pathogens.    To start out, you should wash all dirt and sand off produce; for this wash it is okay to use tap water as long as it is well-filtered, because you will be following it with a sanitizing step.  From here you have two ways to render the vegetables safe.  Blanching is probably the best solution to keep most of the flavor and texture, while still avoiding illness.  To do this, briefly immerse the vegetables in boiling water, and then transfer them to a (boiled) ice water bath.  The exposure to very hot water should kill most pathogens, but by only briefly exposing them to hot water you won't cook them much.    An alternate, but not as effective approach is to soak in sanitizing solution for 15-20 minutes. According to this source, there are a couple good options. One is a ionized silver suspension; in Mexico this is sold as Microdyn or Bacdyn.  Another option is bleach, prepared at roughly 1 1/2 tsp bleach (5.25% hypochlorite solution) per gallon (4 liters) water.  After immersion, bleach should not be rinsed off until just before use, and final rinse should be food-safe water.  Note that rinses will not kill all bacteria, but will significantly reduce their counts.  Use caution if you use an alternate sanitizing procedure: a lot of vegetable washes are just intended to remove waxes and pesticide residue, not kill pathogens.  Even ones with mild antibacterial properties won't cut it, since you need to kill a wide range of pathogens AND parasites: Ascaris worms in particular are common in developing areas and potentially lethal.  Finally, be extra cautious about cross-contamination.  Any fresh produce should be handled as if it's raw meat, because it can carry almost any food-borne illness.  Cleaning should be done before cutting produce, so as to avoid introducing pathogens into the interior.  You'll probably also want to take anti-parasite medications bi-annually to supplement this, since they harder to eliminate from food and may slip through.    Oh, and if you're ever tempted to skip the cleaning steps, remember: there's a good chance your vegetables have poop on them.   Final footnote: there is an EXCELLENT resource on food safety in the Yucatan, by a PhD who worked in public health and for the EPA.  The advice is broadly applicable to anyone living in developing countries. ",

If the heads have been exposed to light and warmth, they turn increasingly bitter. So if you can, buy them from stores where they are kept in dark boxes and choose firm, plump ( = fresh ) heads, then store them in the fridge at home. I would assume a similar mechanism for red chicory / radicchio, but it's not kept dark. But again, pick firm heads.  And then there is preparation: A quick stir-fry will keep the bitter compounds inside the leaves, long braising will tend to extract them into the sauce, making the whole dish being percieved as more bitter.

(3\" high sides vs. the normal 2\" high) You need to reduce the oven temp by about 25°F / 10°C to give the sides a chance to raise before setting, or use cooling strips (or both) and then cook longer, or you'll have significant doming. You may want to use a heating core to speed how fast the center sets.  ",

If the layers are substantially thicker you may need to slightly decrease your oven temperature to ensure proper doneness without drying the cake out.  I use the same batters regardless of the size of the pan or thickness I am looking for. I have 7, 8, 9, & 10 inch cake pans and I regularly vary the diameter and/or thickness of the layers depending on the end result I am looking for, how I want to present the cake, etc.  Regarding my remark about most cakes, there are exceptions. For most cakes, I want a moist cake that doesn't crumble when cut or eaten. Variations don't hurt these layers.  However, I use a different batter when making super thin layers (10 - 12 layers will result in a 4\" to 5\" tall cake).  This batter results in a dryer texture which works well because they get some moisture from the frosting. Being so thin, the level of moisture works out very well. If the layers were moist to start with, the cake would turn to mush. You wouldn't use this batter for any normally thick layers, cupcakes, etc. as it will crumble terribly.  Hope this helps. And, just an observation here (could be my imagination), but it seems like people think thin layers are more special. Maybe they think you put more work into it or maybe it's just that it's more unusual these days to see thin layers. ",

For general reading on scoops for cookies, this King Arthur blog post is good.

        "output_1": "Well, many steak experts have held for years that bone-in steak just tastes better, something about that marrow being good. J. Kenji Lopez-Alt from Serious Eats tested that theory. He found that the steak bones were too impenetrable for the marrow to actually flavor grilling steak, but that the bones provided beneficial insulation:  To test this, I cooked four identical roasts. The first was cooked with the bone on. For the second, I removed the bone, but tied it back against the meat while cooking. For the third, I removed the bone, and tied it back to the meat with an intervening piece of impermeable heavy-duty aluminum foil. The fourth was cooked completely without the bone. Tasted side-by-side, the first three were completely indistinguishable from each other. The fourth, on the other hand, was a little tougher in the region where the bone used to be. What does this indicate? Well, first off, it means the flavor exchange theory is completely bunk—the completely intact piece of meat tasted exactly the same as the one with the intervening aluminum foil. But it also means that the bone does serve at least one important function: it insulates the meat, slowing its cooking, and providing less surface area to lose moisture.  He also mentions that the bone provides a framework to protect the shape of the meat, but it's a pain to carve the bone from the cooked meat:  The best way to cook your beef is to detach the bone and tie it back on. You get the same cooking quality of a completely intact roast with the added advantage that once it's cooked, carving is as simple as cutting the string, removing the bones, and slicing.  (The quote says \"roast\" but in the article he seems to be talking just as much about steak) You mention that bone-in steak costs more at your butcher than boneless. I have not typically found that to be the case. When I have purchased steak, the bone-in has been less expensive than a boneless steak of the same weight of actual meat, cut, and grade of meat.

        "output_1": "You haven't said what you plan to do with the cooked meat, so I'm guessing that you're asking here because you're not really sure how to proceed. I've got a couple suggestions. Cooking ground meat (or anything, really) in the oven tends to dry it out, so you'll want to think about ways to either minimize drying, compensate for it, or use it to good effect. And you probably don't want to just cook a lump of meat by itself -- think about ways to add flavor. Here are two options:   Meatballs. When you make baked meatballs, you spread the meat out and give it a lot of surface area, so it cooks more quickly. All that surface area also means that there will be some drying, but that gives the meatballs a tasty outer surface that browns a bit and adds flavor. Most meatball recipes call for breadcrumbs and milk -- you add the milk to the breadcrumbs in a mixing bowl and let them sit for a bit so that the breadcrumbs soak up the milk. The breadcrumbs help to bind the meatballs together, but they also help to keep the meatballs moist and tender inside. Meatballs also give you an opportunity to add flavor -- I usually add some sautéed chopped onion (which really only need a light shot of cooking spray cook nicely in a nonstick pan), salt, pepper, and herbs like thyme, oregano, sage, or rosemary. Meatloaf. Meatloaf is very similar to meatballs -- you could really use the same mix for either -- but the shape is obviously different. Forming the meat mixture into a single large shape, or cooking it in a loaf pan, reduces the surface area and slows down the drying, but you'll need to cook it longer (maybe an hour compared to 15 minutes or so for meatballs) at a lower temperature.   Eight ounces really isn't enough to make either meatballs or meatloaf -- you'd only get 8 or 10 meatballs. For such a small amount, I'd look for a quicker cooking method like grilling or broiling, and shape the meat to cook quickly. If you really want to cook in the oven, consider shaping the meat into burgers and broiling. ",

If something spoils in the jar it is likely to pop the lid open. Spoilage would give off gasses that would increase the pressure inside the jar and break the seal. This is more obvious if the ring has been removed.  When it comes to juices, unintended fermentation is an issue. Even if raised to a temperature that is expected to kill yeast sometimes some of the little buggers get through and will ferment juices. Without the ring the fermentation breaks the seal. This prevents jars from exploding under pressure (yes, it can happen). I had a grandmother who would can grape juice, but did not want 'wine'. When the lids popped it identified the jars that had fermented, and which could be disposed (sometimes not the way grandma intended).

Each sand mold (minimum of 2 per item) was hand-rammed around a form, which was a wood (later aluminum) \"positive\" of the pan to be produced.  The forms were slightly larger than the finished pan to allow for the shrinkage of the iron as it cooled. Molten iron was poured by hand into the forms, which is as much art as science to do properly.  After the iron hardened the frames of the molds were removed, and the \"raw\" pan was ready for machining. First the \"gates\" on the edge of the pan were removed by nipping/grinding. The pan was then placed in an apparatus similar to a brake drum lathe and turned. A counter-turning grinding burr (shaped as a truncated cone) was run across the cooking surface of the pan. The quality of the result was due to the fineness of the sand used in the mold, the age/quality of the grinding burr, and the skill of the machinist.  The bumps didn't get \"smoothed out with use\".  To my knowdledge, none of the major hollow-ware manufacturers sand-blasted any if their products.  In the late 50's, early 60's, domestic manufacturers had to compete with imports if cheap overseas manufacture.  Labor overhead made the old manufacturing methods economically unviable.  The surviving manufacturers, BSR and Lodge, retooled for automated casting. This led to the thicker, unmilled pans that are with us today.    The spiel about \"the rough surface is for pre-seasoning\" us pure marketing BS.  I bought Lodge dutch ovens in the 70's that had the rough surface and NO PRE-SEASONING. They were, however, shipped with a thin coat of paraffin wax to prevent rusting.  Lodge came up with the \"pre-seasoning\" story years after they started selling un-milled pans (and people complained about how tough it was removing the wax coating).  Older, smoothly milled, properly seasoned pans are WAY slicker than you can get any rough surface iron.  My daily egg-fryer is an unmarked Lodge #5 from the 40's.  It was a $5 crusted-up wreck of a thrift store find. Degreased in a lye bath, further cleaned by electrolysis, and re-seasoned with 6 baked coats of flax seed oil.  With a wipe of oil, over medium heat, the cooked eggs slide around in the pan, nearly as slick as Teflon.  Furthermore, cast iron does NOT do a good job distributing heat, but DOES do a good job retaining heat. Copper, and even cast aluminum, are better heat conductors/distributors. A thinner cast iron pan works just as well as thick one. The only thing that thicker, rough finish cast iron does better than the smooth pans is sear meat.  ",

Per Wikipedia:  [The coffee is] \"under-extracted\", specifically \"under-developed\" – desirable components have not been sufficiently extracted – and \"unbalanced\", specifically sour, because acids are extracted early, while balancing sugars (sweetness) and bitter components are extracted later.  Making good coffee involves a multitude of factors, and it can take some trial & error to hit the sweet spot. But let's mention the major ones:  Yields depend primarily on temperature, brew time, and grind size, and in a complex way on method.  For your case, I'll just call out the most obvious thing: Because you're using a French press, you have to use a coarser grind than something like a drip machine requires. Those larger coffee grains are going to require more extraction time. So it could be that it simply needs to steep a little longer before pushing down the plunger. I personally like to give my coffee a stir for about a minute after pouring in the water to help encourage thorough extraction.

The ideal finished product is crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle. This might be what you mean by mushy, but mushy in my mind is kind of negative. The key to accomplishing this is to let your bread soak in the custard only 30 seconds per side, but then move it to a rack to sit for another 2 minutes further. This extra set time allows the custard to penetrate deep inside the bread, and be distributed much more evenly.  The final trick to getting a nice crispy crust, is to cook it twice. First in the pan/griddle as you normally would, but then 5 minutes in a 375 F oven on a rack. This brief oven stint crisps up the exterior nicely.

Why is that? More generally, how to choose the best temperature for a tea in general (I guess the answer is \"trial and error\", but I'm not an expert in tea so I'd appreciate some basic guideline) ? ",
        "output_1": "I'm going to start by saying: The directions listed on the box or in a guide are good general-purpose directions, for when you don't really want to pay attention to your tea brewing parameters. They're designed to be accessible - not to produce the best brew, but to produce the most consistent one, and one that's acceptable for the tea and for most people. However, the brewing parameters that come with a tea, or 'match' the type of tea, are very often non-optimal. But if you enjoy them, that's usually good enough. However (counterintuitively), most tea can be brewed at most temperatures. This is why I'm posting this answer - because the question you've asked touches on some of the complexity and subtlety involved in getting what you'd like out of your tea. If all you're interested in is making one consistent cup, follow the above paragraph. If you're interested in the 'why' of tea and temperature, read on... and disclaimer in advance that there are no universal truths in tea. Also, this is a bit of a long deep-dive.  Compounds in tea extract at different rates. Most of the compounds that affect the flavor of a tea are quite sensitive to the parameters used in both the production of the tea leaf and the process of brewing. Factors include but are not limited to:  The original grade of the tea leaves (are they whole? are they little crumbly bits?) Structural changes made to the tea leaves during preparation by the tea-maker What temperature you brew the tea at The ratio of tea to water you brew at How long you steep the tea for The composition of the water used to make tea (and if you doubt that last one, check out the Tea Curious blog - they have a series on developing a specialized mineral water for brewing.)  There's no a priori reason to believe that any temperatures should be 'off limits' for brewing any type of tea. In fact, \"oolong\" is not even a single type of tea - it's a very generic name for an extremely broad class of preparation styles, which often call for different temperatures, not a generic 80C. In the generic, all that's known is that many teas become bitter if it's pushed 'too hard': temperature up, time up, amount of leaf up. And the opposite is often true: if you lower temperature, time, or amount of leaf, you can avoid bitterness. In practice, this means that you can, for many teas, compensate for increased temperature using other factors in your brew. Importantly, though - even if you can compensate for a higher temperature by changing the other brewing parameters, the overall flavor is unlikely to remain constant if you change anything at all. Extraction rates for flavor compounds in tea are highly sensitive and change differently relative to each other when brewing parameters change. Maybe, for example, at a higher temperature you'll get more astringency, but other flavor compounds come out much faster, so you can lower the time and make a fine (but differently-flavored) cup. There are even methods that involve 'flash steeping,' where you pour boiling water on a tea and take it out just about as fast as physically possible, and it comes out delicious! Some teas may have an upper bound on temperature, where past a certain point the tea will 'scorch' and become too bitter / astringent before enough flavor really extracts properly. But with the exception of Japanese green teas, this isn't really true on a category-by-category basis as much as it is on a tea-by-tea basis. And even Japanese green teas can sometimes be brewed successfully with boiling water! Generalizations are hard to come by.  In order to talk about oxidization and brewing temperature, we first need to talk about where the temperatures on tea containers and websites come from. It's important to know that the instructions listed on a tea packet are written for an audience to give them a place to start - an audience you may not be a part of. For example, a box of sencha teabags I bought on a whim because it was $1 and I was curious says to pour boiling water on the sencha and steep it for 2-3 minutes. To me, that notionally reads like a preposterous set of instructions, but in reality, it means those instructions were not written for me. They were written for someone without a temperature controlled kettle, making an enormous mug of tea - not someone with dedicated teaware making a small amount of tea at cooler temps. So, oxidization. Oxidization does affect the extraction of flavor from tea leaves, and it has several critical steps in changing the flavor composition of a tea. But it's not nearly as consistent as \"always brew 80C.\" More oxidized oolongs are often able to be brewed at higher temperatures when compared with less oxidized/\"greener\" oolongs, controlling for all other factors, because at those temperatures they will pick up somewhat less bitterness in the tea. However, you can just as easily steep any oolong at a high temperature for less time by controlling the other parts of a brew - and in fact, this is what I do with most of mine. So, white tea. I'm not sure exactly where the idea came about that white teas are exceptionally delicate and must be brewed with care at a specific temperature, but in general, white tea is not (generally) particularly delicate. In my opinion it's one of the hardiest teas, because most white teas can be brewed effectively at essentially any temperature, without much worry about astringency coming into the brew. The thing is, under most circumstances, you can brew a good white tea at a boiling temperature. That's how I do it, most of the time. But if I'm looking for a different kind of flavor palette, maybe I'll turn down the temperature...  tl;dr: Don't let the temperatures on guides and boxes constrain you. They're an OK starting point, but most tea can be made at most temperatures. The numbers you see are just there to provide a broadly consistent brew that most people will probably enjoy - not because they are some theoretical optimum for brewing. As always, the best cup is the one you enjoy. ",
        "output_2": "The \"best\" temperature for preparing tea is the one that makes the tea taste as you like it. That being said, most people don't brew their black tea at a lower temperature of 70° C, while conversely not brewing green tea too hot. From what I found on several websites on the quick (I'm not a white tea drinker), the consensus seems to be to treat white tea about the same as green tea, i.e., to brew it with a lower temperature in the 70° - 80° C range.

The more this deep red is diluted, it will subsequently become red, orange or yellow in colour.

        "output_1": "You would use the flat bottom spoon as you would use a regular spoon. The main different between the flat-bottom spoon and western spoons is as you can see the flat bottom and the fact that the flat bottom spoons are usually bigger and can hold more liquid. I'm not sure why it would be awkward to use it compared to a regular spoon. You don't need to stick the whole spoon in your mouth. There is a rounded edge around the spoon before it is flat. You put just the rounded portion of the spoon into your mouth and drink from it.   The reason for the larger spoon probably stems from the fact that many Asian soups have noodles and large chuncks of vegetables and meats in it. Using a western spoon, you would get some of the noodle or meat and have little room for the broth. But with the larger flat bottom spoon you can get the noodle, meat and still fit an appropriate amount of broth on the spoon.  EDIT:  Also note that it is common practice to use the flat bottom spoon and the chopsticks simulataneously while eating a bowl of noodle soup. One would use the chopsticks in their dominant hand (right hand lets assume). They would then use their left hand to use the spoon. As you have probably experienced in your life unless you are ambidexterous, using the left hand to do thing you normally do with the right can be hard. With the flat bottom, there is less chance of spilling than with a traditional rounded spoon. ",
        "output_2": "The Asian or Chinese flat bottom spoon not only has its application in holding more soup broth  and/or liquid, its material, usually made of ceramic or porcelain tends to keep its handle cool even when immersed in a hot soup unlike the European/Western metal or silver soup spoons. The flat bottom also makes them easy to store as they are stackable. In addition, the ceramic/porcelain construction of the spoon is less likely to scrape the bottom or sides of a ceramic/porcelain soup bowls especially the elaborate decorative bowls. The Chinese cuisine has been using such spoons for (almost 3,000) years and its application and contribution is so important in many Asian tables. Use it as you would like a metal Western/European soup spoon. ",

Of the two, the sponge cake is somewhat lighter, so if you have been making pound cake (cream butter and sugar, add eggs, then flour), you can switch to sponge (foam eggs and sugar, add flour and fat). But both are hearty homemade cakes, they are supposed to be dense.   The iced cakes you get in a bakery are much lighter, because they use a different type of layer. Most types of cake are lighter than pound and sponge cakes. Try making genoise, chiffon, or angel food cake layers, they are all light. And yes, using cake flour will help too, or replacing part of the flour in the recipe with pure starch (usually cornstarch or potato starch, you can also use wheat starch if you can get it. Tapioca or arrowroot aren't that well suited). For a real \"pro\" taste, also throw in some lecithine, it makes the mouthfeel softer and smoother - but if you don't feel like hunting around for lecithine, don't bother, a good homemade cake doesn't really need it, I only mentioned it because you asked about \"cake made by a pro\".

        "output_2": "What do you mean by \"traditional/proper\"?   A lot of Indian food is named simply after the ingredients in it - cucumber salad would probably just be cucumber salad.  Sometimes they are named after the type of cooking method or vessel they are made in. Your Karhai broccoli is an example of that; the karhai (or karahi) is a type of pot used in Indian cooking. It's similar to a wok and usually looks something like this:  If you're looking for the single definitive name that goes with each recipe in that book, you won't find one. The \"traditional\" name for each dish would just be the recipe title translated into whichever Indian language is most prominent in the region the dish came from. But the translation isn't going to be a \"proper\" name because it will still be generic; there are so many regional variations on common dishes (variation in ratio of vegetables or meat, or in types and amounts of spices, etc.) and so many languages spoken in India that no dish has a single name or way of making it.  Take any dish that is a staple of Indian food and search for that dish name + \"recipe\". I guarantee you'll come across nearly infinite variations. (Try something like \"aloo gobi\" - the translation of these Hindi words is literally just \"potato\" (\"aloo\") and \"cauliflower\" (\"gobi\"). I've seen hundreds of recipes for it, and no two are exactly the same, but they do contain common ingredients.) Depending on where you are in India, they are sometimes called by English names, too; you might go to a restaurant and see \"cucumber salad\" on the menu with no explanation of what type of cucumber salad it is.  P.S. \"Roasted Moong Dal with Mustard Greens\" is a hybrid Hindi-English dish name already (another common trend in urban India). \"Dal\" just refers to a dish made with pulses, which are usually cooked until soupy/mushy or occasionally pureed. \"Moong\" is the type of bean used; you sometimes see it spelled \"mung\" or written \"mungbean\" (one word) - you can take a look at the Wikipedia page for a more exhaustive list of varieties on the nomenclature.

The recipe I have calls for a 2:1 ratio of cream of tartar to baking soda which is consistent with the proportions in How do I make a baking powder substitute? and What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder? What can I do to reduce the tanginess? Edit: Here's the recipe from a 50 year old Betty Crocker cookbook (American measures):  1 C shortening 1 1/2 C sugar 2 eggs 2 3/4 C flour 2 tsp cream of tartar 1 tsp soda 1/4 tsp salt Cream shortening and sugar. Beat in eggs. Sift together all dry ingredients then add gradually to the shortening mixture. Roll into 1 1/2\" balls and roll in a mixture of 2 Tbsp sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon (you'll need more than this). Place about 2\" apart on an ungreased baking sheet (you can use Silpat or parchment). Bake at 400°F for 8 - 10 minutes. They should be lightly browned but still soft. If you prefer a crisp cookie, add a minute or two to the baking time. They'll puff up then flatten with a cracked top. Makes about 5 doz. 2\" cookies.  I've slightly modernized the instructions, but there's really no changes. I've used what we in the US call \"cinnamon\" which is actually Cassia (it's what you get at the grocery store and what you grew up on if you're American). If you buy Vietnamese or \"Saigon\" cinnamon that's what you're getting. I've also used true cinnamon (Ceylon). To me, it made the cookies taste very \"Christmasy\" and was a nice variation. ",
        "output_1": "I think you're using twice as much soda/tartar as you should. I use a rule in all of my baking to use 2% weight of flour as leavener (that goes for yeast and baking powder). I do everything by weight and in the metric system to make my life a whole lot easier. But for your recipe it should ½tsp baking soda, 1tsp cream of tartar. I bet your snickerdoodles didn't turn out as bad as mine when I didn't have any cream of tartar or baking powder left, and I used sodium diacetate instead.  (That's vinegar powder, btw) ",
        "output_2": "If they're tangier than you'd like that would be due to the acidity of the cream of tartar.  While most recipes for Snickerdoodles do in fact us cream of tartar and baking soda for a homemade form of baking powder (most likely due to the fact that snickerdoodles are fairly \"old\"-style cookie), a few I looked at are using baking powder and no cream of tartar.  Here are a few things to know and a suggestion:  Acidic doughs do not spread easily and do not brown easily.  Using the combination of cream of tartar in the 2:1 ratio w/ baking soda for leavening not only causes them to puff but with the higher acidic ratio it is also likely to help in keeping them more \"cakey\" and prevent them from browning as much.  You could try cutting back the cream of tartar slightly and seeing if that helps (possible drawback could be the soda making a more pronounced bitter soapy taste if there isn't enough acidity).  Or  Replace the cream of tartar and baking soda with baking powder.  Baking powder by volume isn't as powerful as baking soda because of the fact it contains soda, two dry acids, and cornstarch.  1 teaspoon of baking powder will leaven 1 cup of flour (vs. 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda to leaven a cup of flour).  If your recipe calls for 2 cups of flour then use 2 teaspoons of baking powder and cut out the cream of tartar and baking soda. ",

I have made this stew before successfully, but this time the meat was very tough! I'm trying to troubleshoot, so here are some details.  First, I browned the meat (chuck). Then I caramelized some onions and deglazed the pan with a bit of beef stock. The beef goes back in the pan with enough beer to just cover it. Then I cooked it in the oven (covered) at 175C for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. I had checked it at the halfway point to see how it was going, and the meat was still tough. To my disappointment it was still tough even at the two hour point.   My guess is that either the meat I bought is just a bad/old/tough batch (it was precut stew meat), I didn't have the oven low enough, or didn't cook long enough (though the classic recipe says two hours should be sufficient). I know browning gives you great flavor, but could it make the meat too tough? Should I have had even more or less liquid? What do you think?  I'm really a novice in the kitchen so all of your comments are appreciated. ",

Try giving yourself 4 and a half hours from start to serve, 3 and a half for cooking at 150C and 1 hour for resting, that should give you a more consistently tender result.  ",
